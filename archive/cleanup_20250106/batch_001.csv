Conor McCloud returns from the Crusades to discover his cousin has taken possession of Inverness, the McCloud castle. Fighting back to reclaim his family home, Conor makes a promise to a dying friend: seek out the woman who a witch said could heal the land...a woman from another time and place.
Eilan Dougan has taken leave from her Colorado river rafting business to help sell her parents' Seattle antique shop. Her uncanny ability to sense others' thoughts has always set her apart -- and when a dark Highlander appears and begs her help, she can't refuse. But fourteenth-century Scotland is no place for a woman with Eilan's powers. Now instead of Eilan saving Conor, Conor must rescue Eilan from charges of witchcraft -- and decide whether love can withstand the ultimate test of time.","----print-books,-2007-read,0-my-library,9-scotland,9-usa,90-938-1485-medieval,91-2000-now-early-21st-century,authors---r,books-to-buy-2,books-to-buy-tt,contemporary,currently-reading,donated-8-1-2015,fantasy,hard-copy,historical,historical-romance,historical-time-travel,lb-bc5,maybe,medieval-romance,not-overdrive,paranormal,passport2romance2016,physical-book,read-b,romance,romance-scotland,romance-time-travel,science-fiction,setting-scotland,time-travel,time-travel-books,time-travel-romance,to-read,tossing,wish-list","fantasy, paranormal,fiction,history, historical fiction, biography,romance",71186,Pam Binder,3.8,1139,,,,40,5,3.4799999999999995

A Harper has always lived at Harper House, the centuries-old mansion just outside of Memphis. And for as long as anyone alive remembers, the ghostly Harper Bride has walked the halls, singing lullabies at night...
Hayley Phillips came to Memphis hoping for a new start, for herself and her unborn child. She wasn't looking for a handout from her distant cousin Roz, just a job at her thriving In the Garden nursery. What she found was a home surrounded by beauty and the best friends she's ever had-including Roz's son Harper. To Hayley's delight, her new daughter Lily has really taken to him. To Hayley's chagrin, she has begun to dream about Harper-as much more than a friend...
If Hayley gives in to her desire, she's afraid the foundation she's built with Harper will come tumbling down. Especially since she's begun to suspect that her feelings are no longer completely her own. Flashes of the past and erratic behavior make Hayley believe that the Harper Bride has found a way inside of her mind and body. It's time to put the Bride to rest once and for all, so Hayley can know her own heart again-and whether she's willing to risk it...","2005,3-stars,adult,adult-fiction,audio,audio-book,audio-books,audiobook,audiobooks,author-nora-roberts,books,books-i-have,books-i-own,books-owned,bookshelf,borrowed,chick-lit,contemp-romance,contemporary,contemporary-fiction,contemporary-romance,currently-reading,default,done,drama,e-book,e-books,ebook,ebooks,family,fantasy,fantasy-paranormal,favorite-authors,favorites,favourites,fiction,fiction-romance,fluff,garden,ghost,ghosts,have,i-own,in-the-garden,in-the-garden-trilogy,kindle,library,library-books,love,m-f,magical-realism,modern-romance,my-books,my-library,mystery,mystery-suspense,nora,nora-roberts,nora-roberts-books,nora-roberts-in-the-garden,nora-roberts-j-d-robb,nora-roberts-jd-robb,nora-roberts-read,noraroberts,novels,nr,own-it,own-to-read,owned,owned-books,paperback,paranormal,paranormal-fantasy,paranormal-ghosts,paranormal-romance,part-of-a-series,personal-library,re-read,read-2010,read-2013,read-in-2013,reread,roberts,roberts-nora,romance,romance-contemporary,romance-novels,romance-paranormal,romances,romantic,romantic-suspense,series,supernatural,suspense,tennessee,to-buy,to-read,trilogies,trilogy,wish-list","fantasy, paranormal,fiction,mystery, thriller, crime,romance",625,Nora Roberts,4.08,3147263,197855.0,In the Garden,5.0,30574,715,4.07

The military is Marine Colonel Joe ""Magnus"" Rivers' reason for being. Protecting the United States of America from all threats is his sole purpose in life. His world is turned upside down when a woman is assigned to his team of elite Marines and his attraction to her threatens his career.
NCIS Special Agent Emily Patterson's orders: infiltrate Colonel Rivers' team and find the culprits behind a rash of kidnappings connected to a sex slave ring. Her mission parameters didn't include an attraction for Colonel Rivers but nothing in Emily's career could have prepared her for Magnus. Her job becomes more difficult as she gets to know the man behind the uniform and Emily finds herself wanting to prove herself to him, potentially exposing her identity before she clears Magnus.
Magnus and Emily struggle against their growing feelings for one another, both knowing the consequences of giving in to lust. Magnus is Emily's team leader and fraternising is against the rules. Emily is investigating Magnus and his team; getting involved with him could ruin her investigation and her career.

She's a wild, artistic and outspoken fashion designer. He's a type A, workaholic trauma surgeon (who just happens to be sizzling hot and her brother-in-law!). But Janica is about to be proven wrong when opposites attract...in the sexiest possible way.
After a life-changing night in the ER, Luke is desperate for escape - and relief from his personal demons. For five years he has fought his attraction to his sister-in-law, but when he's pushed too far, he can't fight it another second. He needs her. Desperately. He's spent his whole life doing the right thing. For one night, he's going to follow desire instead. Straight into Janica's arms.
Janica can't believe Luke is finally at her front door...and that he's kissing her like he's been waiting his whole life for her. But even as their sensual connection deepens with every touch of skin on skin - and the man she always thought was such a good boy turns out to be sinfully, toe-curlingly bad between the sheets - Janica soon realizes she wants more than Luke's body. She wants his heart too. But what will Luke do when one night of extreme passion turns into an all or nothing proposition?","2,2012-read,2012-reads,2013-reads,3-stars,adult,adult-fiction,adult-romance,alpha-male,amazon-freebie,andre-bella,author-bella-andre,bella-andre,bella-andre-books,belle-andre,books-i-own,calibre,chick-lit,contemporary,contemporary-romance,could-not-finish,currently-reading,default,did-not-finish,dnf,downloaded,e-book,e-books,ebook,ebooks,erotic,erotic-romance,erotica,favorite-authors,favorites,fiction,free,free-ebook,free-ebooks,free-kindle-books,freebie,freebies,friends-to-lovers,have,i-own,ibook,ibooks,kindle,kindle-books,kindle-ebooks,kindle-free,kindle-freebie,kindle-freebies,kindle-lendable,kindle-library,kindle-loanable,kindle-read,kobo,lendable,lendables,m-f,mf,modern-romance,my-books,my-kindle-books,new-adult,nook,on-kindle,on-my-kindle,opposites-attract,own-a-copy,own-ebook,own-kindle,own-to-read,owned,owned-books,owned-to-read,part-of-a-series,part-of-series,read-2012,read-2013,read-in-2011,read-in-2012,read-in-2016,romance,romance-contemp,romance-contemporary,romantica,series,spicy,steamy,steamy-romance,take-me,tbr,to-read,to-read-ebook,to-read-free,to-read-own,to-read-owned,unread-on-kindle","fiction,romance",37249,Bella Andre,4.07,226023,217624.0,Take Me,2.0,7920,335,3.77

Agent Brant Scott knows when a battle is lost. He's been an integral part of hunting down members of the del Fuego cartel for years, but it's not the violent criminals that have the ability to bring him to his knees. That honor belongs to one woman. And after spending a night in Darcy MacKenzie's bed, he knows he has to disappear from her life or risk her finding out the one secret that can make her despise him forever.
Darcy MacKenzie is hell on wheels. At least that's what her brothers tell her. And when she has the chance to work with the elite team assigned to destroy the most dangerous drug cartel in the world, she jumps at the chance to lend her expertise by deciphering the Mayan hieroglyphs the cartel is using to send messages.
The only problem is her partner is none other that Brant Scott--the only man she's ever loved and the one who left her without a backward glance. With secrets of her own--and a body built for sin--Darcy is more than an equal match for the stubborn Brant. But loving each other could be more of a risk than either is willing to take.","0-this-book-is-part-of-a-series,2013-reads,4-star,a-liliana-hart,action,action-suspense,adult,adult-romance,alpha,alpha-male,alpha-male-romance,audiobook,big-bad-sexy,books-in-a-bundle,calibre,contemporary,contemporary-romance,cops-private-investigators,currently-reading,damaged-hero,downloaded,e-books,e-kind,ebook,ebooks,erotic,erotic-romance,erotic-suspense,erotica,family-series,favorite,favorite-authors,favorites,fiction,friends-to-lovers,hart,hea,ibooks,incomplete-series,kindle,kindle-books,kindle-unlimited,kobo,law-enforcement,library,lilian-hart,liliana-hart,lilianna-hart,lilliana-hart,love,mackenzie-brothers,mackenzie-family,maybe,men-in-uniform,mf,military,military-men,military-romance,my-books,mystery,mystery-crime,mystery-suspense,need-to-download,nook-books,older-man-younger-woman,own-to-read,owned,owned-books,part-of-a-series,possessive,pregnancy,quick-read,read-2014,read-in-2013,read-in-2017,reading-list,rom-suspense,romance,romance-contemporary,romance-erotic,romance-suspense,romantic-suspense,rt2013,series,series-to-read,shelfari-favorites,suspense,suspense-mystery,suspense-romance,the-mackenzie-brothers,the-mackenzie-family-series,to-be-read,to-buy,to-read,to-read-1,to-read-series,waiting,want-to-read,wish-list,z-audible","fiction,mystery, thriller, crime,romance",4905702,Liliana Hart,4.06,98730,421127.0,The MacKenzie Family,28.0,2672,151,4.34

To avoid his teasing questions and his you-can't-fool-me remarks, Emma and her ugly dog Wyeth flee to sparsely populated Lister Island in the Puget Sound, where Emma intends to devote the summer to her painting and art.
On Lister Island, Emma encounters a pistol packing priest, a pair of greedy organic food farmers, an octogenarian jail keeper and Ryan Everett. Soon, Emma is much more concerned about her heart than her art. After a series of disturbing coincidences, Emma suspects that the life of Helen Dunsmuir, Lister Island's recently deceased grande dame, is tied to her own. As she unravels the secrets of Helen's life--and untimely death--Emma learns that problems are rarely solved with a quip or platitude, and that it's better to love than to comment.

When her apartment building is blown to smithereens, bumbling hitwoman Maggie Lee is forced to move back into the Bed & Breakfast she grew up in.
Living with her three meddling aunts is bad enough, but it just so happens that the B&B is also occupied by a U.S. Marshal, an FBI agent, her old friend Zeke who's on a mysterious mission, and a woman who claims she can see dead people. These aren't the kinds of roomies Maggie wants to spend time with, considering that in order to pay for her niece's medical care she supplements her income by killing people.
Maggie avoids arrest and deals with a crazier-than-usual home life while trying to track down exactly who is blowing up the holdings of various crime families. To make matters worse, she's walking a precarious tightrope between keeping her mobster bosses happy and protecting her murder mentor (and almost lover) Patrick Mulligan.
Aided by the warped predictions of her semi-psychic friend, her sarcastic, demanding, talking lizard and an always ravenous, dyslexic Doberman, Maggie juggles keeping secrets, unraveling riddles and protecting those she loves. Can she do it all? Or will she suffer yet another unspeakable loss?","01-1_english,01-2_funny,01-2_love_evil,01-3_books,01-3_u250,03-series-wish-list,1-my-library,2-read-purchase,2016-books-read,2017-read,3-5-stars,3-chick-lit,5stars,8-series-10-15,a-amazon-wish-list,assassin-bounty-hunter-vigilante,author-l,available-to-loan,blackkindle,book-5-in-a-series,books,c-purple,chick-lit,chick-lit-crime,contemporary,cozy-mysteries-read,cozy-mystery,cozy-mystery-amateur-sleuth,currently-reading,e-book,e-books-to-read,easy-read-quick-read,ebook,fantasy,favorites,fiction,fiction-humor-read,following-series,fun,fun-series,funny,funny-mystery,funny-romance-all,got-it,h,hitwoman,horror,humor,humorous,ibook,kickassladies,kindle,kindle-library,lendable,light-hearted,light-hearted-comedy,maggie-lee-series,misc-series,murder-crime-mystery,mybooks,mys-sus-romance,mysteries,mystery,mystery-suspense,mystery-thrillers,nook,not-as-currently-reading,not-read-yet,on-kindle-have-not-read,own-kindle,owned,owned-amazon,owned-and-unread,paranormal,pc-100-199,popcornbooks,psychic,purchased-borrowed,rated,read-2016,read-before-feb-20-2015,read-in-2014,read-not-rated,romance,romantic-elements,romantic-suspense,s,sequential,series-and-sequels,series-tbr-pending,strong-female-lead,suspense,suspense-thriller,talks-to-animals,tbr-2013,tentative-reading,the-hitwoman,thigh-slapper,to-purchase,to-read","fantasy, paranormal,fiction,mystery, thriller, crime,romance",4855436,J.B.

Mareo and Foma have been searching for their other mate for centuries. Now that they think they've found him, Virgil's running from them. Panicked that he's only staying in Greece a few days and confused by his reaction, they decide to take desperate measures. After their plan backfires instead of opening up Virgil to being their mate, can they convince him they were only trying to help?

Vali Florescu, heir to a powerful local boyar, flees his father's cruelty to seek his fortune in the untamed Carpathian forests. There he expects to fight ferocious bandits and woo fair maidens to prove himself worthy of returning to depose his tyrannical father. But when he is ambushed by Mihai Roscat, the fearsome Crimson Outlaw, he discovers that he's surprisingly happy to be captured and debauched instead.
Mihai, once an honoured knight, has long sought revenge against Vali's father, Wadim, who killed his lord and forced him into a life of banditry. Expecting his hostage to be a resentful, spoiled brat, Mihai is unprepared for the boy to switch loyalties, saving the lives of villagers and of Mihai himself during one of Wadim's raids. Mihai is equally unprepared for the attraction between them to deepen into love.
Vali soon learns that life outside the castle is not the fairy tale he thought, and happy endings must be earned. To free themselves and their people from Wadim's oppression, Vali and Mihai must forge their love into the spear-point of a revolution and fight for a better world for all.","0-mm,0wns-e-book,1-own-ebook,100-200pg,2016-reads,4-star-reads,a,a-ebook,a-length-100-150-pages,a-own,a-read-in-2016-ereader,a-stand-alone,abuse,body-ginger-or-redhead,character-assassin-enforcer,character-military,character-peerage-or-royalty,cheaper-reads-under-2-dollars,check-to-read,currently-reading,d-2-5-stars,did-not-finish,dnf,e-book,e-romance,ebook,ebooks,ebooks-own-to-read,ebooks-sent-to-kindle,enemies-to-lovers,erotica,fantasy,fantasy_mm,fiction,from-riptide,gay,gay-historical-romance,gay-romance,gay-romance-100-199-pages,genre-high-fantasy,genre-historical,genre-sff,historic,historical,historical-fiction,historical-romance,historical-setting,historical_mm,i-own-dropbox,inventory-ebooks,investigate-further,less-than-125,lgbt,lite-read,locale-russia,m-m,m-m-romance,male-male,maybe,maybe-later,mm,mm-etal-tbr,mm-historical,mm-romance,mm-tbr,mogai-lgbtq,my-kindle-tbr,net-galley,netgalley,novella,outcome-hea,own-ebook,owned,owned-yuv,pdpm,pub-2013,purchased-dreamspinner,read-not-reviewed,riptide,riptide-publishing,romance,romance-historic,romance_mm,romania,sexcontent-anal-play-sex,sexcontent-bareback,sexcontent-butt-virgin,sexcontent-frottage,sexcontent-oral-play-sex,sexual-mix-m-m,sorted-mm,sounds-good,stand-alone,tbr-have,thieves,to-read,to-read-next,to-read-owned,truly-awful,unavailable","fantasy, paranormal,fiction,history, historical fiction, biography,romance",1289325,Alex Beecroft,3.67,4523,,,,120,38,3.37

Thirty one years of marriage has left Masey bored and sexually frustrated. When her husband, Wally, ruins a night of potential foursome play she sets off on her own for Bali or Thailand... or wherever the hell else she can land, leaving Wally drunk, bruised and naked on the front lawn.

The language is harsh, the imagery startling and the characters are probably your next door neighbors. F-bombs galore follow Wally as he discovers his own coming of age - thirty years past due, yet still just as confusing.

What happens when two lovers close their eyes, literally or not; when they tumble into a love they never expected; when they decide it's worth the risk to stay . . . or time to leave?","adult-fiction,author-provided,author-requested-review,ebooks,first-reads,goodreads-first-reads,random,romance,romantic-erotica,romantic-fiction,short-stories,short-story-collection,to-delete,to-read,well-developed-characters","fiction,romance",7266026,Barbara L.B.

And Celeste is scared. Alienated because she's too smart, her speech too affected, her social skills too far outside the norm, she seems to have no choice but to retreat into isolation.
But college could set her free, right? If she can make it through this grueling senior year, then maybe. If she can just find that one person to throw her a lifeline, then maybe, just maybe.
Justin Milano, a college sophomore with his own set of quirks, could be that person to pull her from a world of solitude. To rescue her--that is, if she'll let him.
Together, they may work. Together, they may save each other. And together they may also save another couple--two people Celeste knows are absolutely, positively flat-out in love.
Whether you were charmed by Celeste in Flat-Out Loveor are meeting her for the first time, this book is a joyous celebration of differences, about battling private wars that rage in our heads and in our hearts, and--very much so-- this is a story about first love.","2014-books,2014-read,2014-reads,2014-release,2014-releases,2015-reads,3-stars,4-5-stars,4-stars,5-star,5-stars,all-time-favorites,amazon,audible,audio,audio-book,audiobook,audiobooks,book-boyfriend,book-boyfriends,books-i-own,books-read-in-2014,chick-lit,college,college-romance,coming-of-age,contemporary,contemporary-romance,currently-reading,cute,did-not-finish,dnf,drama,e-book,e-books,ebook,ebooks,ebooks-i-own,emotional,family,favorite,favorite-author,favorite-authors,favorite-books,favorites,favourites,favs,fiction,finished-series,flat-out-love,friends-to-lovers,friendship,funny,funny-as-hell,high-school,hilarious,humor,jessica-park,kindle,kindle-books,kindle-unlimited,lendable,library,love,loved,made-me-cry,must-read,my-favorites,na,new-adult,on-my-kindle,owned,owned-books,read-2014,read-2015,read-2016,read-in-2014,read-in-2015,read-in-2016,read-in-english,realistic-fiction,reviewed,romance,sequels,series,sweet,sweet-guys,sweet-romance,swoon-worthy,to-buy,to-read,want-to-read,ya,ya-books,ya-contemporary,ya-fiction,ya-na,ya-romance,young-adult,young-adult-romance","fiction,romance,young-adult",22159,Jessica Park,4.04,106009,588583.0,Flat-Out Love,3.0,8314,1137,4.27
