41328045,['22013911'],Crash,2014,['eng'],296.0,"Will Pardini is a temptation Natalie does NOT need right now.
Months after calling off her engagement, Natalie is trying to rebuild her failing career and impress her eternally disappointed parents. She has too much on her plate already, but the offer Will gives her - to travel the world working as a graphic designer for his luxury hotels - is much too tempting to refuse.
Reformed bad boy billionaire Will Pardini has had his fill of ditzy golddiggers. Natalie is everything he'd ever hoped for but never dreamed could be real. Around her, he's just a normal guy.
Around her, he doesn't feel like such a monster.
Will has been hiding a dark secret... one that shows up just when he thought he would be able to move on with his life. One that threatens to tear apart the fragile connection he's been building with Natalie and turn his world upside down.
Is it right to let someone love you more than you deserve to be loved?

Book One of a three book trilogy.
Nick O'Hara is a veritable womanizer. The only qualifications that he looks for in a romantic connection is that the person is hot and breathing. Mainly hot. He has no desire for an emotional connection with another person, and that's the way he lives his life. He has his fabulous wealth and his reputation as a premiere architect, and that's enough for him.
Until Scotty James.
Scotty is a graduate student at Columbia University in New York City. She's broken from traumatic experiences from her years in foster care and homelessness. She has a vulnerability that is intoxicating to Nick, because, deep down, he knows that he is as broken as she.
When Nick pursues Scotty, it seems that she is the only woman who doesn't want to be with him. At first she's a challenge, but Nick soon finds himself falling in love for the first time in his life. With a woman who wants nothing to do with him.
Can Scotty overcome her trust issues and fear to let Nick in? Or will she prove to be too broken to trust?

What woman in her right mind would say no to marrying the dashing Duke of Sedgemoor? Miss Penelope Thorne, that's who. She's known Camden Rothermere since they were children-and she also knows she'd bring nothing but scandal to his name.
Cam can hardly believe Penelope turned down his proposal. But if she wants to run off to the Continent and set the rumor mill ablaze, he can't stop her. Then her brother's dying request sends him to bring home the one woman he thought he'd finally gotten over.
The only way they'll both get back to London without their reputations in tatters is to pretend they're married during the journey.

Female shifters are all but going extinct on his planet of Qurilixen, and his people are desperate for mates--so much so they're taking matters into their own hands. What better place to capture a woman than Earth? After all, dragonshifters had come from there centuries ago. Surely a human female would be honored to be selected by one as fine and fierce as himself.
While on Earth, Kyran stumbles upon the most beautiful woman he's ever imagined, singing something the natives call rock 'n' roll. His blood simmers and he knows Eve is the one for him. But taming this feisty female is going to take much more than his training prepared him for.
A Dragon Lords Romance
About the Series
Captured by a Dragon-Shifter is a modern day prequel series installment to those first books. They take place long before the princes you know and love ever found their mates, long before The Dragon's Queen, in a time when the dragonshifters and catshifters actually--wait for it--liked each other and hung out as friends. They also don't have Galaxy Brides to bring them women. What they do have is the old portal that they used to escape Earth. There's no one left to marry on the planet and things are starting to get desperate.","00find,1,1-fantasy-sci-fi,1-tl,1-tl-pnr,1st-in-series,adult,alien,alien-romance,aliens,aliens-mostly-the-hot-hot-variety,audible,audio,audiobook,audiobooks-unread,book-i-dont-want,books-i-have,books-that-i-cant-find-online,box-set,bundle-multi-author,captured-by-a-dragon-shifter,contemporary,currently-reading,dont-have-it,downloaded-audio,dragon,dragon-heroes,dragon-shifters,dragons,e,erotic,erotica,fantasy,fantasy-ish,favorites,files-eeee,finished,gedownload,guy-royalty,guy-were-animal,have-but-need-to-read,itunes,kindle,kobo-books,lendable-purchased,library,m-f,magical-adventures,michelle-m-pillow,michelle-pillow,must-read,my-owned-books,my_ebooks,my_library_unread,mÅste-mÅste,nook,november-2014,on-hold,on-kindle-waiting-to-be-read,on-my-kindle,own-audio,own-kindle,owned,paranormal,paranormal-romace,paranormal-romance,paranormal-urban-fantasy,pnr-want-to-read,purchased,queued,read-2015,read-in-2017,received-audio-book,romance,romance-alien,romance-sci-fi,romantic-mystery,sci-fi,sci-fi-romance,science-fiction,science-fiction-romance,series-do-not-own-whole-series,shape-shifter,shape-shifter-romance,shape-shifters,shapeshifter,shapeshifters,shapeshifters-weres-dragons-etc,shifter,shifters,shifters-and-vampires,smuttylicious,sub-genre-pnr,summer-read,tablet,tbr-romance,to-be-read-pile,to-read,to-read-paranormal,want","fantasy, paranormal,fiction,mystery, thriller, crime,romance",8604,Michelle M.

Simone Cooper's been watching Elliott Anderson through her office window for months. He likes to bring women back to his office for late-night trysts, and Simone enjoys her voyeurism until one night, Elliott appears to go too far with his date. The other woman might not be into spanking, but Simone is, and when she meets Elliott in the elevator later that night, she makes sure he's intrigued enough by her to ask her to go with him to the party he no longer has a date for.
Thrown together by circumstances he'd never have imagined, Elliott isn't sure what to think about Simone. She's nothing like the women he normally dates, but something about her draws him in until he can't stop himself from wanting her...until their goodnight kiss becomes something harder. Harsher.

Amelia Jones knows the truth; she lives and breathes it every day. The endless monotony of a loveless marriage, and years of domestic slavery stretch before her in minutes and hours that are destined to end in a mental breakdown.
Then Alexander Reeves walks through the door.
Her new boss is intriguing, charismatic and clearly driven by unspoken demons, and while Amelia knows she's playing with fire, she's relentlessly drawn to the man. Alexander is just as taken by her, but knows that giving into temptation can only end in disaster.

In book six of the Galactic Cage Fighters: Zen the Sin is the hottest male in the Galaxy according to the Galactic Times and every woman who attends a GCFA fight. Being charming comes naturally to Zen, giving him the ability to play the part of the Galactic Cage fighter playboy--well. He poses with fans, signs autographs, and is a pro at doing commercials. No one sells sex better than Zen the Sin. So when the Galactic Times sends a female to do a two week long expose; it should have been just another day in the life of Zen the Sin. Problem is, she doesn't seem to fall for his usual playboy routine nor does she seem swayed by his good looks.
Shawna Baker jumps at the opportunity by the magazine she works for and agrees to do an in-depth interview with the fighter known as Zen the Sin. She has been waiting for this day to come for years, a chance to travel on the Galactic Cage Fighters ship and get to learn about a man from her past. The only drawback is having to deal with a well-known womanizer but decides that if he gives her a hard time then she would dig up dirt on him, there should be plenty. What she doesn't count on, is Zen isn't all he seems to be--he has many layers, discovering the easy going man is much more complicated. Against her will she becomes instantly intrigued by him, leaving her craving to peel back each layer to find the real man underneath. Not everyone is happy with Shawna's presence on board the GCFA ship, including a mother who is furious with her for taking the job and does not want her to have anything to do with the halfsies, especially Zen.
Things soon become complicated and dangerous when her presence provokes one of Zen's fans--one who has begun to stalk him. Will Shawna get past her preconceptions and her mother's hatred of all halfsies? Will Zen open up, allowing someone to get close to him? Can they overcome the hate and fear before it tears them apart? Or will Zen's easy nature be his downfall when the stalker turns deadly?","1,2014-botb,3-paranormal-series,4-star-regular,6th-in-series,abduction-captive,action,action-adventure,adult-stuff,alien,alien-aliens,aliens-space,alpha-male,amazing-crazy-supporting-friends,awesome-kickass-heroine,books,cheesey-but-entertaining,currently-reading,dropbox-finished,ebook,erotic-romance,fantasy,favorite-books,favorite-paranormal-books,fight,fighter-boxer-wrestler,fun-easy-read,future,futuristic,have,have-it,hero-hardcore-alpha-possessive,heroine-turns-down-hero,hot-aliens,hot-males,intergalactic-sci-fi,kindle-loan,kindle-read,lite-read,lovely-snoopy-crazy-family,m-f,man-whore,mystery,non-nook-books,out-of-this-world,outer-space-romance,pages-100-150,paranormal,paranormal-fantasy-sci-fi,paranormal-romance,paranormal-series,possessive-men,psycho-bitch,psycho-stalker,read-alpha-males,read-me,read-mma,read-syfy,reformed-rake,romance,romance-erotic-scifi,sad-haunted-tortured-past,scarred-hero-heroine,sci-fi,sci-fi-alien-worlds,sci-fi-romance,science-fiction,science-fiction-romance,scifi-futuristic,scifiromance,search-the-net,sex,sex-time,shorter-less-than-200,si-fi,si-fi-romance,snarky,sports,strong-female-mc,sub-genre-edit,supernatural,t-aliens-or-other-planets,to-read,to-read-sci-fi,untranslated-yet,warriors,wish-list","fantasy, paranormal,fiction,mystery, thriller, crime,romance",6449643,K.D.

Aria had meticulously constructed her world- both in the boardroom and in the bedroom. Her life was exactly as she wanted it and everything made sense...before Aiden. After Aiden, was an entirely different story. Aiden's disarming and unrelenting allure eventually stripped Aria of her protective shield allowing Aiden emotional and sexual access that she'd considered forbidden to any man. Aiden forced emotions to the surface that Aria had rebuked since childhood, touching a part of her that she found disturbingly unfamiliar. She now finds herself in a unique position as she shuffles to regain her balance and reassemble the pieces that Aiden left in his wake. But how will she suppress what Aiden somehow managed to awaken?
Led by career aspirations, Aria reluctantly maneuvers within Aiden's orbit and their forced pairing eventually hits several hurdles. Is Aria strong enough to fight her instincts and remain in Aiden's world? Will her initial reservations resurface, confirming her convictions that love can only result in tragedy? Or will Aiden ultimately convince Aria that love isn't the disaster she always thought? Regardless of the option Aria chooses, Aiden's past and other secrets will unfold, forcing Aria down a path she never saw coming.","01-books,1,2017-books,5-stars,8-er-nr,adult,alpha-hero,angsty,annoying-female,audible-audiobook,bc,bcm,books,books-2-blog,books-i-want-t-read,books-on-my-kindle,bored,contemporary,currently-own,currently-reading,d-n-f,dark-romance,deleted-from-kindle,did-not-finish,dnf,erotic,erotica,erotica-bsdm,fave-trilogy,favorites,favorites-books,favourite-series,got-bored,hot,hot-hot-hot,kindle,kindle-book,lilly-wilde,marvin-library,melissa,must-read,my-aggies,need-to-read-now,new-adult,no-thank-you,not-reading,now-acquired,over-crying-female,read-but-not-reviewed,repetitive,review-passionate,rich-guy,rich-hero,romance,second-chance,series,series-complete,tbr-list-2015,to-read,too-descriptive,too-long,too-much-inner-dialog,trilogies,trilogy-s,unfinished-serial,untouched-trilogy,wait-for-complete-series,workplace",romance,8577407,Lilly Wilde,4.55,1507,823062.0,Untouched,6.0,301,71,4.57

44715898,['25038798'],Dearest Stepbrother: Twin Soldiers #2,2015,['eng'],,"Eden didn't know her twin stepbrothers, Elliot and Zane very well. Growing up together since she was ten, the older boys relentlessly teased her, finally leaving home to join the Army when she was seventeen.
When Eden was nineteen, the twins returned home completely different from the boys they'd been when they left home. They ignored Eden after returning, most of the time not noticing when she was in the room.
On a drunken night out, Eden forgot her key to get back into the house and decided to knock on Elliot's window to get back inside. She expected him to be angry because she woke him...she knew he'd laugh because she was caught sneaking out. But what she didn't know was how her stepbrother felt about her. An innocent mistake leads to a night of discovery about herself and her stepbrother.
Will Eden be able to resist her stepbrother? Will Elliot be able to show Eden all the things she'd been missing by not having him in her life?
Dearest Stepbrother: Twin Soldiers 2 is the second book in a four part series.

ABOUT THE INHERITED STARS SCIENCE FICTION ROMANCE SERIES:
The year is 3500 AD--more or less. No one really keeps track anymore. Since the fall of peacekeeper planet, LaGuardia, two centuries before, much has been lost. Few remember that LaGuardia was once known as Draxis. Fewer still have knowledge that Draxis once guarded a spatial vortex--a crossrip in time and space--and passageway to a legendary world called Earth where the human species originated. Somewhere, hidden in a forgotten archive, is the written history of the known universe and the chronicles of the men and women who helped forge a future in the stars.

A childhood promise has Chance Walker picking up a guitar once again. Sure, he's been busy growing up, finishing college, and even law school. He made a promise to his dying mother and he's determined to keep it. While his guitar playing dreams were big when he was a kid, his skill is rusty and he hires Erin Michaelson to bring music back into his life. Not only is she incredibly talented, she's one of the sexiest women he's ever met. It's hard to focus on correct finger position when her sweet scent threatens to drive him out of his mind.
Less than twenty-four hours after his first lesson he sees her again, but this time she's on stage using another name and seducing an entire audience of men. He played the gentleman card once, and it got him nowhere. This time, all bets are off and he'll do whatever it takes to keep her. A single, sizzling backstage kiss will change both of their lives forever, because Chance soon realizes that Erin is not just an itch, she's an obsession that he refuses to live without.
Erin Michaelson spends her days teaching guitar and her nights on stage as her sexy alter-ego, Eva James. Music is her dream, her passion. All she wants is to say goodbye to a lifetime of scraping by, working two jobs, and paying for past mistakes. When a major record label exec hears her band play, she gets her big break. But life can be a real bitch, and meeting Chance now is just bad timing.
Problem #1: The record label wants her to dump her band and move to L.A. Problem #2: She hadn't counted on Chance Walker and the scorching heat of that first kiss. And last but not least is Problem #3: Is Chance really falling in love with the dull guitar teacher, or is he really just lusting after the sexy Eva James?

Abandoned once too often, Brooklyn Myers never intended to return to Thunder Creek, Idaho. Her hometown holds too many memories of heartache and rejection. But when her estranged husband Chad Hallston dies and leaves his family home and acreage to her and their ten-year-old daughter Alycia, it's an opportunity to change their lives for the better--a chance Brooklyn can't pass up, for Alycia's sake if not her own.
Derek Johnson, Chad's best friend since boyhood, isn't keen on the return of Brooklyn Myers to Thunder Creek. He still blames her for leading his friend astray. And now she has ruined his chance to buy the neighboring ten acres which would have allowed him to expand his organic farm. To add insult to injury, Chad's dying request was that Derek become the father to Alycia that Chad never was. How can he keep that promise without also spending time with the girl's mother?
Brought together by unexpected circumstances, Derek and Brooklyn must both confront challenges to their dreams and expectations. He must overcome long held misconceptions about Brooklyn while she must learn to trust someone other than herself. And if they can do it, they just might discover that God has something better in mind than either of them ever imagined.","1st,2015-2018-books,2017-50-states-challenge,2017-books,2017-books-read,2017-challenge,2017-finish-the-sentence-challenge,2017-mixed-up-abc-challenge,2017-reading-challenge,2017-reads,2017-to-read,adult,adult-to-read,arc-reviewer,audible,audiobooks,available-at-library,blogged,book-look-bloggers,books-i-own,books-of-2017,books-read-in-2017,borrowed-library-book,cant-wait-for-unreleased-books,challenge,christian,christian-fiction,christian-fiction-books,christian-fiction-deverourers-reads,christian-fiction-romance-toread,christian-romance,clean-romance,completed-in-2017,contemporary,contemporary-fiction,contemporary-romance,could-not-finish,currently-reading,dnf,dnr,e-library-ebook,ebook,eventually,family,family-relationships,favorites,fgtc,fiction,fiction-books,fiction-guild,forgiveness,free-from-conference,friendship,g-twn-library,giveaways,hatcher-rl,hatcher-robin-lee,horses,i-own-a-copy,import-sort,inspirational,inspirational-fiction,kindle,kindle-ebooks,kindle-own-a-copy,library,library-challenge-2017,loaned-on-deck-reads,love-stories,marriage,maybe,mini-review,mother-daughter-relationship,must-read-to-finish-series,my-books,netgalley,new-books,not-owned,not-read,on-my-bookshelf,order-in-process,parker-library,pb-ready-to-read,pub2017,publisher-supplied,read-in-2017,reading-next,reviewed,robin-lee-hatcher,robin_lee_hatcher,romance,romance-christian,spiritual-themes,the-fiction-guild-books,thomas-nelson,to-read,want-to-read,y-books,y-religious-inspirational,y-romance-contemporary","fiction,romance",62524,Robin Lee Hatcher,3.96,22553,,,,300,107,4.1

Benjamin Snowley is trapped in a most distressing predicament. He's been feeling poorly and after having recently recovered from influenza, he knows that the fault for his declining health lies in a vice he wouldn't dare mention in polite conversation.
Onanism, self-pollution, masturbation. All names for the same sinful affliction.
For Benjamin, it all started back at school, where he first encountered the immoral Frederick Cory. Ever since then, the man has been plaguing Benjamin's dreams and causing most unnatural urges.
Now is the time for all the infatuation nonsense to stop. With the help of an unorthodox doctor and an indecent proposition to a young stablehand, Benjamin will rid himself of the vile addiction.
But can the experimental treatment be enough to make him forget his feelings for Frederick?

Wolf shifter, Mac, has been waiting for the Goddess to send his mate, but he's growing impatient. After fifty years of celibacy, he is more than ready to meet the one woman that is his perfect match.
