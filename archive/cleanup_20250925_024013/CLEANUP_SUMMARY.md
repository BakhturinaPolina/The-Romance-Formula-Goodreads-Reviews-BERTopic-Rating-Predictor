# Cleanup Summary - 2025-09-25 02:40:13

## Overview
This archive contains files that were cleaned up from the main project directory to reduce clutter and improve organization.

## Files Archived

### 1. Test Outputs (`outputs/` directory)
- **dedupe_growth_test/**: Test outputs for deduplication growth testing
  - Multiple parquet files with cluster metrics, edges, and pairs
  - Meta.json configuration files
- **dedupe_refined_test/**: Refined deduplication test outputs
- **dedupe_sample_test/**: Sample deduplication test outputs  
- **dedupe_sample_test_strict/**: Strict sample deduplication test outputs
- **mapping_test/**: Token mapping test outputs
- **normalized_test.csv**: Normalized test data

### 2. Log Files
- **eda_analysis_logs/**: EDA analysis log files
  - `page_count_investigation_20250920_002531.log`
  - `page_count_investigation_20250920_185643.log`
  - `page_count_investigation_20250924_175724.log`
  - `page_count_investigation_20250924_180519.log`
- **cell3_pipeline.log**: Main pipeline log file

### 3. Nested Duplicate Structure
- **nested_duplicate_structure/**: Duplicate project structure found in `src/eda_analysis/romance-novel-nlp-research/`
  - Contains duplicate outputs and analysis files
  - Appears to be an accidental copy of the main project structure

### 4. Python Cache Files
- All `__pycache__` directories were removed from the project
- These are automatically generated Python bytecode cache files

## Rationale for Archiving

1. **Test Outputs**: These are temporary test results that can be regenerated and don't need to be in the main project structure
2. **Log Files**: Historical log files that are no longer needed for active development
3. **Duplicate Structure**: Accidental duplication that was causing confusion in the project structure
4. **Cache Files**: Automatically generated files that can be recreated as needed

## Impact

- **Reduced project size**: Removed unnecessary files and directories
- **Improved organization**: Cleaner project structure without test artifacts
- **Better maintainability**: Easier to navigate without duplicate structures
- **Preserved data**: All files are safely archived, not deleted

## Recovery

If any of these files are needed in the future, they can be retrieved from this archive directory. The test outputs can be regenerated by running the appropriate test scripts.
