# Data Cleanup Summary - 2025-09-25 02:46:36

## Overview
This archive contains processed data files that were cleaned up from the `data/processed/` directory to reduce storage usage and improve organization. These files represent intermediate processing steps and duplicate data that can be regenerated if needed.

## Files Archived

### 1. Large Intermediate CSV Files
- **romance_books_main_cleaned.csv** (195MB) - Intermediate cleaned dataset
- **romance_books_short_form.csv** (75MB) - Short form romance books dataset
- **romance_books_anthologies_collections.csv** (55MB) - Anthologies and collections dataset
- **romance_books_unexplainably_short.csv** (29MB) - Books with unusually short page counts

### 2. Step0 Content Inspection Files
- **step0_content_inspection/** - Complete directory containing:
  - **canonical_mappings/** - Shelf canonicalization processing files
    - Large parquet files (69MB, 7.9MB, 2.8MB)
    - Multiple JSON chunk files (2.1MB each x 6 chunks)
    - TF-IDF vectorizer pickle file
    - Various metadata JSON files
    - Sample CSV files for inspection

### 3. Duplicate Pipeline Complete Data
- **duplicate_pipeline_complete/** - Duplicate of test sample pipeline results
  - Contains identical files to `test_sample/` but in a separate directory
  - Includes step1_normalized and step2_topics results
  - BERTopic model files and configurations

## Rationale for Archiving

1. **Storage Optimization**: Removed ~360MB of intermediate processing files
2. **Duplicate Elimination**: Removed duplicate pipeline results that were identical to existing test_sample data
3. **Intermediate Step Cleanup**: Archived intermediate processing files that can be regenerated
4. **Organization**: Kept only the final processed dataset (`romance_books_main_final.csv`) and active test_sample data

## Files Retained in data/processed/

- **romance_books_main_final.csv** (166MB) - Final processed dataset (kept as this appears to be the main output)
- **test_sample/** - Active test sample data and pipeline results (kept for ongoing work)

## Impact

- **Reduced storage**: Freed up approximately 360MB of disk space
- **Cleaner structure**: Removed duplicate and intermediate files
- **Better organization**: Clear separation between final outputs and archived intermediate steps
- **Preserved data**: All files are safely archived, not deleted

## Recovery

If any of these intermediate files are needed in the future:
1. **Intermediate CSVs**: Can be regenerated by re-running the data processing pipeline
2. **Step0 content inspection**: Can be regenerated by re-running the canonicalization process
3. **Duplicate pipeline data**: The original test_sample data remains available

## Storage Savings
- **Total archived**: ~360MB
- **Files archived**: 4 large CSV files + 1 complete directory + 1 duplicate directory
- **Maintained**: Final dataset and active test sample data
