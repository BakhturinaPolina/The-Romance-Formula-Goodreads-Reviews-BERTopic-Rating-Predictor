i liked the passion between the characters, but i found the ending to be glaringly obvious right from the beginning.	train	2410820
did i embark in it anyway?	train	45911680
he let her control how far they went and he took his time admiring her and basically loving her with everything he had.	train	19113823
i shy away from paranormals these days because, dunno.	train	24380106
i loved how rebecca was a strong woman who was willing to fight and work for her rightful place as news anchor.	train	56358435
"this book: the ultimate ladies-fantasy, or ""turn-about-is-fair-play"" on most men's fantasies."	train	27677153
what i love about blade's character is he is not himself around honor, he tries to win her trust, taking gentler steps with her.	train	19058959
audiobook, great narrators and a good story of a professional woman who has a ton of baggage and giant of a man who wants to help her move past it.	train	44908160
i didn't red the reviews posted mainly because this was part of a bundle set of books.	train	25003085
i have to say callie made this story for me.	train	6777627
so i really liked it!	train	25959792
they are adorable together, and the tacit (and not so) encouragement from the stiletto and oxford crew is just enforcing that fact, even as they add huge humor and interest to the story.	train	44960981
what a nice surprise!	train	15714317
i would totally recommend this book to my friends and family.	train	26220514
my main issue was the lack of connection i had with the characters, more specifically, with cam.	train	49916977
then they fell in love.	train	24333050
"bad things happen when i wasn't in control."""	train	45650278
it wasn't necessarily the writing i had an issue with, but the plot and the characters.	train	1032900
the selection is predictable and follows its genre predecessors relatively closely.	train	15413183
yes please!	train	46308251
there's nothing about this book i can fault.	train	44737717
suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuch an amazing story so far, i immediately bought the second book!	train	17499464
a sweet heartwarming story.	train	40787535
i would have given it 5 stars, but it was to short.	train	16101664
in fact, it felt really great to have characters going through what was more of a daily life story than a save the world story!	train	5790090
but everything, everything had such fantastic characterization that i didn't need a thrilling plot to get invested in the story.	train	26540216
left with very little money from his family, he sets out to do what he does best, and he is upfront about it with jessica. (	train	13626536
there could have been so many great things done with this book but they were all poorly executed.	train	25626888
on one hand, he was hot, possessive and very alpha.	train	14524855
i also appreciated that this book talked about mental illness and an absent family.	train	45813875
even those she loves always seem to let her down.	train	23743714
most of the country is doing it's best to survive, clutching at hope wherever they can find it.	train	14568028
overall, there is something about how this author writes that i find so compulsively readable.	train	42967253
so much so that i looked to see if the library had book 2 available.	train	15413183
i'll admit it...i love books and movies about fake boyfriends who turn into real boyfriends.	train	49000989
"""it's going to hurt until it doesn't hurt anymore."""	train	52951446
what he went through was terrible and it reflected in the way that he acted throughout the novel.	train	23678657
since leaving acting, his famous family has shunned him and his rebellious ways, his tattoos and wild lifestyle an affront to their snobby society ways.	train	25685033
there is another installment coming, right?	train	22957415
"""that you were so wicked."""	train	846763
it didn't feel like a rehashed romance story with a cliche plot.	train	25189752
but, whatevs that is just my take on how the book should have ended.	train	25207434
not a very well done one in my opinion but i didn't really get invested in this story enough to care.	train	26473363
of course now the happy couple are having some issues.	train	25032522
the heir and the spare.	train	42439906
stuff that balances out the bright-and-shiny.	train	51414129
naturally, as with any book, the two start to find that they are more drawn to each other than either had ever intended to be.	train	41252132
i don't want to give any specifics away because there were some things i never saw coming and a reader needs to experience it for themselves.	train	45650278
no way had something that fucking powerful skipped your attention.	train	25313644
i am glad that crownover let rule continue to grow up because he had a lot of that to do still by the end of this story.	train	23675925
i find it annoying and stupid.	train	19143978
i felt that he walked away from me natalie too many times, for me to really fall head over cheese-wheels in love with.	train	44737722

she took care of her brother and sister while her parents remained clueless.	train	44222940
i think it will be hard to duplicate the reading experience of the oti book and for me it didn't happened this time, but objectively speaking it is a good read for romance book lovers.	train	45282421
i loved over the fence, but the fill-in boyfriend had one of those hfn endings where i needed more.	train	20938637
iris, from the wild side series makes many appearances and at least we find out exactly what happened to her when she was missing from dair's life (the hero from the afore-mentioned series).	train	42371640
okay, i've had enough of this.	train	21955497
the letters, sent from a soldier during wwii to his sweetheart, open her heart to a love she's never experienced.	train	39938149
smart, seductive, caring, and upfront.	train	46209108
the flash backs really did it for me, it connected the story so effortlessly.	train	24567191
everyone is different and handled things in different ways, but it would have been nice to see evidence that she truly wanted things to change.	train	43006457
must read if you love romances!	train	16441531
very character-driven, heart-wrenching story of one man's, one lover's, and one family's, struggle with ptsd.	train	12802050
there was very little deep conversation between them for nearly 3/4 of the book, they saw each other briefly or avoided each other instead of confronting feelings that were obviously crackling between them.	train	47277149
a fun light novella read that i really enjoyed as a palate cleanser in between books.	train	55565386
levi is by far i think my most favorite male.	train	21365435
i need the next part now.	train	41048988
he treats women like trash, he has no respect to any other human being and especially females, he beats up people whenever they look or say something wrong to his 'precious' abby, he's sexist, possessive and everything of the above.	train	16441531
ultimately, for me, it's still a great story, because it's about two totally imperfect people who are sort of perfect for each other. (	train	16327730
i would have given this book 5 stars but i think the first 3/4 of the book was just sex without a story line.	train	21877684
worth the read.	train	47277149
wow this book is so unique!!!	train	25888071
evelyn has been with michael since she was fourteen, but something feels off with their relationship.	train	42702668
though it's entirely honest, the realization scares me.	train	41252132
the author has succeeded in creating a moving story, filled with lust, love, and passion.	train	44345797
could not put it down!!so funny and cute and the love story was great!!	train	21607771
i liked how the guys loved their families.	train	21957233

mian is a strong heroine and will sacrifice anything for her son, caylen.	train	53566217
but the ending tho!	train	26107172
i liked seeing their relationship go through its ups and downs and while her dad was a bit frustrating at times, i still liked his character.	train	26198862
i also knew this was a love story of sorts, but i couldn't help thinking 'this guy is going to rob you and rape you and no one will ever find you.'	train	17992862
i hate i'm having to wait to read the next one, but hopefully time will pass quickly.	train	20397129
what a novel happenstance.	train	26416947
trevor, hands down.	train	45722376
in this book, you will see when ronnie judges other people even before she really knows them so she will definitely understand them in a wrong way.	train	6588800
i think i will give the author another try.	train	46829911
enjoyed it as light entertainment and a quick read.	train	3220771
i was really looking forward to reading this series but after reading the first book, i don't know what to think.	train	21970768
still a good and engaging story, but missing some things.	train	25632486
the beginning of this book is like a normal high school story but boy did it change.	train	24070983
he doesn't want another human, chew toy or bunny.	train	19121365
but now thinking back i enjoyed the funny and easy parts more than the serious ones because that's how life is too.	train	26540216
naomi gets a little annoying and ethan/javier deserve awards for dealing with her but for a relitivly short story it's well rounded.	train	16695756

i really enjoyed it.	train	16101664
april surprised me.	train	14147661
the distopian future theme, the drawing of names and a few other parts of the book felt eerily similar to thg.	train	15413183
their agreement was sex no strings but who can really keep their heart out of it ?	train	24884078
this novella, is short and crisp but packs a mean punch in the adorable and heartwarming department.	train	23580012
she has been in love with cam since she was 13 and he was 18.	train	2251118
now-all that being said, this book is very 'readable' and sucks you in.	train	48870448
"loved this book..i read it within hours and jumped right into the second book, ""up to you"" how can you not love it...i mean cash/nash...hot, sweet, sexy how does a girl choose ;) cant say much more, not without giving big secrets away... leighton didnt let me down again..every book draws me in and i want more..."	train	21763760

it was calming in a way.	train	17026278

just like the other series i had a hard time putting it down and wasn't ready for it to end!	train	25548680
a quick read with a fun narrator (my second first-person romance in a row, which is a bit of a change).	train	44995729

i found myself laughing so much at that.	train	45537337
it didn't.	train	25570700
it's like watching a romantic comedy - you just know they'll end up together - but it's soo much fun to watch them get there like the scene where slade threatens to sue her if she doesn't accompany him to a business dinner with his bosses.	train	24510895

they had a bit of a rocky patch at the end of the last book, but things are good now.	train	43014517
i found the plot drew me along at a nice pace with just enough intrigue to keep things interesting.	train	25264357
return][return]however, i found the story light on plot and heavy on convenient, predictable events.[return][return]while i'm not likely to run out and get the next book in the series, i would recommend it to teens who like supernatural themes.	train	6244926
even if i hadn't read the first two books, i think there's enough information conveyed here that you could read it as a standalone.	train	42705766
i cannot wait to hear zachary webber and andi arndt narrate this one!	train	51201665
i feel like there needs to be more now so, we can find out what happens with addy and franny.	train	43014520
as with a lot of short form erotica shorthand is necessary to get from the beginning to the end and especially when introducing the many personalities that are sure to populate this series.	train	6543745
i can't recommand it enough.	train	43207111
you suspect the romantic twist a mile away, and the characterizations are a little confusing.	train	3920010

kurt is another plus for me in this story!	train	14515040

i liked how she was getting bolder and bolder, how she started to stop taking commands from her brother for granted, how she started to stand up for herself, how she stumbled and fell on her own and more especially how she stood right back up with a smile and laughter that shone like the sun, or as james described it xd i liked how she didn't hesitate in her pursuit of james, how she knew she wanted him for him, how she knew he was the one for her, and they were meant to be together ^^ - i liked alf and i hope later on she gets her own book with her own prince or knight, and i'm looking forward to the next book, it certainly is has as interesting couple, with the heroine being the duke of montgomery's sister, and him being the way he is.	train	40728147

if you enjoy a bit of kink and a well written story- try this one out.	train	24485326
enough of that though.	train	41404800
i started reading it because it had great review, great recommendation and i said why not.. i mean everybody loves this book, so it must be something really great.	train	14188292
i thought it was boring.	train	1488992
the story, the characters, the intersecting plots and the torrid romance are all trademark christine feehan and all together it makes for a good read for die hard fans and maybe an interesting introduction to her style for new readers.	train	45911680
while i went in without very many expectations, i actually loved this book!	train	21805183
the author is after all writing what and how she sees the story.	train	18034963
again...damon's character is amazing as well as jo's character..:) another cliffhanger novel, the twist of the story was a jaw dropping moment for me i really didn't see it coming.	train	24244435
how did he not change back into an old man?	train	16751534

dude, you got played.	train	44707128
this book has it.	train	33630802

i fail to see the deep connection, the mystical love between cora and matt.	train	15282063
all in all, a great read.	train	16751534

evony is a strong female warrior with mad archery skills.	train	49715084
what bothered me the most about broken was that the sexual tension came out of nowhere (like really out of nowhere, olivia wants to sleep with paul when she's just seen his back) and that all secondary characters were just pawns of the story, with no real personality--the whole thing revolves around paul and olivia and that's all.	train	33027161

and while i'm a big fan of protracted tension between the two main characters, this one tended heavily toward the sexual variety and i tend to like mine a little more cerebral.	train	3863622

"because she is so funny, and everything just ""happens"" to her, and she is so not in control of her life, or any situation really."	train	21807237
she is well aware of garrett's playboy ways and while she is reluctant to be his next conquest, she wants to make this life my bitch and wring every bit of juicy goodness from it before it's possibly taken away from me.	train	42670856
this book was addicting, steamy and left me anticipating the second book.	train	48870448
i feel like too many books utilize this damsel in distress technique to endear male hero's to the reader, which for me comes across to one-demensional in this setting.	train	19113823
there gets payton.	train	44153095
he is everything you search for in a bff and he never seems to let you down.	train	16441531
i gave two stars because it is well written so i could finish the book but i will forget about the story in five days...	train	21805183
it was harsh and painful and it left a gaping wound in my heart.	train	49157919
i'll be looking forward to reading her next in this series and in the faerie series.	train	6244926
but because i loved the first book so much, i am goig to try to read the third and see if it will get better.	train	20397129

it had enough murder, enough hollywoodish setting and enough romance that it kept the pace going and held my interest.	train	51398738
thank you jessica!!!	train	22957415

this book was really great and i remembered penelope from simon and juliana's book.	train	15333212

qhuinn has come from a high born family but was disown from it.	train	1928049

i really enjoyed this book.	train	24034716
insta friends.	train	23630615
i am always on the look-out for new authors and river jaymes is my new, new favorite!	train	27085211
i skimmed a little on this one because it didn't grab me like the other story.	train	42796027
seems too dramatic to me.	train	16441531
she doesn't pull away.	train	23851721
and some of the things he said had me wondering what made him more upset.	train	17572318
this was a very average paranormal romance.	train	2621331
i actually wish that it's longer.	train	19022487
this may prove more difficult than it sounds.	train	29348
melissa, who is going by mia while in france, has changed her hair and looks to disguise herself from the general public.	train	44287701

brittany is an endearing character and someone who we all know.	train	4315675
it's a very cheesy book but i like cheesy once in a while!	train	25463804
i never feel like i just couldn't get into the story, or felt the guy and gal didn't have any chemistry, because i can truly say i have never felt that way about her books.	train	53682202
this secret could be the end of them having a chance to have a happy ever after.	train	18226669

i loved how their relationship developed, slowly but surely.	train	42494964
"the writing irritated me, and it just generally took me awhile to really ""get into"" it."	train	2523603
so instead it seems as though max hates her.	train	51198386
it's just like reading a soap opera instead of watching one on tv.	train	17868608
i didn't care for noah.	train	14147661
the plot was sort of non-existent.	train	45749039
what predictable, annoying book.	train	18034963
i don't get the why?	train	25423130
i was really disappointed when it ended and i'm bouncing up and down, eager for the next one in the series!	train	15413183
while this was less edgy and gritty than the previous books i have enjoyed by karina halle, i enjoyed it for what it is.	train	43454866

i thoroughly enjoyed this book.	train	14294481
i like the premise, ellie is starting to grow on me, and for some reason javier has become my favorite character.	train	21799599
"""who else is hoping douche bag ends up the same way jack did?"""	train	25205902
there were so many spelling and grammatical errors that i often times had to skip a sentence because it did not make any sense.	train	23675925
i loved how protective of ian he was as well and it did make more sense how he treated beth once we knew why.	train	13432302
the other characters are mac's wild friend amanda, co-workers charlie, dr. drake (who likes mac) and big doris (her supervisor).	train	24526767
which i only do for books i can't wait to have, and then i still don't buy them hard back.)	train	6244926
drew was too good to be true, but i bought into it and believed it every page:) loved it loved it loved it.	train	42102987
the endings did not feel unnatural or premature, i just wanted a little bit more story to take in.	train	21497162
i also really loved the unique format used to tell this story.	train	26540216
book description from publisher: recently, vampire queen carling's power has become erratic, forcing her followers to flee.	train	15737277

i love stories that are entertaining and fun to read.	train	14601010
love it great story!	train	45341154
i think what made it so enjoyable was how easy it was to follow and understand and fall in love with the characters.	train	6244926
the heroine was smart and beautiful and not even a bit annoying.	train	15334257
also, something else that i really enjoyed in the book was the mixed media.	train	26540216
i appreciated all of the research, hard work and dedication that it must have taken to write this novel.	train	17897317
the two of them were palpable together-unstoppable.	train	43190257
this means that the novel reads well and everything flows together as she obviously has experience writing.	train	42751762
nina lacour is awesome.	train	25626888
last but not least, i really, really, really enjoyed the badass alpha biker, talon.	train	25988122
for example... you think you're fat( or maybe you really are, i don't care) you pretend that you aren't... you don't keep saying how fat and ugly you are to others... if you pretend enough, someone is bound to believe you... and if someone offends you, you can shrug and say how you like feeling like a natural and real woman, with big tits and ass... and you'd rather having some meat than spend your life on a diet and being a bitch... btw guys hate being called a bitch more than women... use it!	train	40901308
books 1 and 2 of the bow street runners were not my favorite offerings from kleypas.	train	679364
so now the king is evil.	train	20397129
i would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't for the cliffhanger.	train	21833091
i loved this book and i can't wait for the third book!	train	44707128
not only does this book suck you right in from the beginning, but it leaves you thirsty for more.	train	21388692

i need this right now!	train	26424157

i couldn't think of anything but him for days after	train	16813814
i didn't think he was cheating though.	train	41518378
karina halle's writing is realistic, witty, and fabulous...i am a fan for life!	train	26633339
i give escaping reality, 5 amazingly thrilling stars!	train	24670263
lucas is hot as ever (of course) but at one point made me so mad i wanted to throw something at him (you'll see why), and i like that he stuck with his guns and his realisation at the end didn't feel forced or rushed in anyway.	train	41616689
the writing itself was good, but the main plot is silly (really, you're going to either completely commercialize an entire town or not based on which teenager wins a boat race?),	train	42396868
can't wait to start on the redhead revealed!	train	10561678
there are some scenes in the book, (ie: one with the cat, and one with the apron) that i was actually laughing out loud!	train	21607771
now, she's divorced and he's back home after suffering an injury while in the military that basically forced him out.	train	47255210
i love everything sophie kinsella writes.	train	51414129
this is what made me give this book one star: sometimes the wording did flow, but that's just an editing issues.	train	42869269
it's like candy honestly.	train	21408119
but honestly this was worth the wait for me.	train	43210684
it's so hogwarts.	train	7168450
but they're getting harder and harder to find, right?	train	41719510
the hero completely made me fall in love with him - he's loyal, kind and heroic in the true sense of the word.	train	43190257
i don't normally like contemporary novels, i'm more of an escapist reader but i absolutely love this book.	train	25463804
she's an original, and i highly recommend this book.	train	26746176
the more tarryn books i read, the more i become obsessed with her dark, somewhat depressing way of bringing love and life to light.	train	25697736
so about connected... when i say that you really want to be adding this book to the top of your tbr list, i am not saying it because i call kim a friend.	train	22380673
i really enjoyed the prince.	train	25543523
trust me, you don't want to test me.	train	25808543
anyone else think that?	train	10706071
to me, eva handles everything too well.	train	25032522
garrett was no exception.	train	42670856
killian is just the ultimate rocker - i loved him.	train	49842522
the book of broken hearts is one of those books.	train	21526221
arc provided by netgalley.	train	47750522
children lost through disease.	train	43190257
at first, i thought he was a huge jerk but then i realized how amazing was.	train	20938637
as a pair, they were wonderful.	train	6443939
i found myself rereading his pov multiple times to form an understanding of what many must endure as a regular thought pattern.	train	44648888
this story is amazing and i can't recommend it highly enough.	train	25463804
after reading and falling in love with the first book in this series, the look of love, i have to say this follow-up left something to be desired.	train	17468404
is it wrong that my favourite characters are minor or secondary characters?	train	42484814
they were all stereotypical and annoying.	train	21807237
after a long time, i've finally returned to a genre that has always been dear to me, and boy was i welcomed back in style!	train	14855973
it was good until they go to bed.... then wasting the time.	train	41048988
i won't belittle or assume things from now on!	train	45282421
gayle forman is such an incredible author and i loooove her writing style.	train	10706553
"this line: ""because that's the thing about change."	train	45749039
i was very close to not continuing this book because reed and ella's relationship was atrocious, especially at the beginning of the book.	train	48870448
to be honest, i didn't like the beginning at all.	train	41678122
i think maybe they had too many issues to work through in such a short time.	train	10379217
and the cherry on the top - he can cook.	train	21799599
and he is a great character.	train	10706553
as i am not exactly a massive of romance stories, i am glad that the romance between the characters jess and ed wasn't the central storyline but it added a nice touch to the book overall.	train	25570700
it takes the danger in their prison to finally be the catalyst that brings them back together.	train	42460655
overall i really enjoyed the story of knox and ellie and how he was superstar athlete who had decided not to have sex till he found the right girl.	train	45789536
it sounded creepy when he called her sweet girl, like he was talking to a little girl.	train	25338951
her theory is who is going to believe that travis had anything to do with what happened at keaton hall if they were anxiously waiting to get married.	train	26234107
tear* he went to save his mother's house, it was so sweet and i started to understand him better.	train	6777681
i mean i kept on having wtf moments during the book.	train	21500353
good job amelia hutchins.	train	25127069
"so i smacked him on the a**. """	train	26116275
so i suggest to them that until they acquire some class and learn to accept good and bad reviews graciously, to refrain from working in the publishing business.	train	15413183
i'd have to say this would be the most disappointing book i've ever read in this series.	train	18229973
the inmates are brutal, violent and fresh meat is fought over.	train	24236730
i enjoyed this book and think it is a must read for all the fans of the series!	train	17026278
but here, it's important to the whole story.	train	6244926
at first i thought joise was being a bitch and being so rude to him even if he wanted to try but nope she kept pushing him away.	train	49250379
it seemed as though we were barely introduced to him and his personality before he was all of a sudden asking sara to marry him.	train	6155268
i liked her the most just for that.	train	16393328
the story is based in a small town in sugartown where ana works in her family's pie shop which is based opposite her dad's garage.	train	25888071
so he has some kinky side to him ( which the book hasn't mentioned exactly what).	train	50618062
you just never know what the fuck is going to happen or what her characters will have to endure.	train	53566217
it worked very well, and gave me a swoony moment that stuck with me, and was this lovely quiet inclusion that affirmed that trans boys are boys and might be crushed on by heterosexual girls, which felt really good to me as a trans reader.	train	45749039
"""it shall be my pleasure to remedy it."	train	18054770
cassandra needed time to forgive logan, and i didn't find myself getting frustrated with the character like i normally would in this type of situation.	train	25425864
also i really don't think anything was resolve with their own personal issues, they just finally decided they were in love and decided to be together.	train	39847614
the characters are engaging and delightful.	train	47109482
i think the author made her a good representation of woman being self conscious and unsure of their bodies.	train	6543745
oh and small town status too!	train	42218550
but lizzie is a smart, competent woman.	train	42912504
the inclusion of curling might have something to do with it, to be honest.	train	39847614
i hear it's supposed to be a trilogy, but there's really nothing in this book that i found interesting enough to merit a second and a third.	train	6244926
her parents were extremely well to do and have always been more focused on fancy parties than raising their daughter.	train	23675925
i loved the setting, i'm a sucker for anything that takes place in ireland and the village of connemara, with a pub named the pot of gold, and surrounded by windswept moors and craggy cliffs.	train	23590822

yeah, yeah.	train	21868234
trust me on that one.	train	22382845
the usual christmas ball, hosted by lord benedict sheffield is in danger of being cancelled this year due to a fire that damaged his ballroom.	train	42816293
the second half of this book just wrecked me.	train	44831742
since the death of her family in a fire (which is just about all we know), amy was saved by someone that she calls her 'handler' who has this unique tattoo on the inside of her wrist, and who continues to protect her.	train	24670263
i loved it.	train	15093690
they seem to follow a formula where a teenage girl, who is normally bright, loses all common sense when she falls head over heels for a non-human hunk of a vampire/werewolf, djin.	train	6244926
that's a crock.	train	25205902
i was glued to every page, i'm so interested in their world.	train	41902808
okay, this view is probably a little biased because i have so much respect for all great mothers out there but i stand by what i think is right.	train	26540216
"she named a few reasons that didn't happen, but none of them were ""i don't think my husband would want me to carry my ex's child""."	train	42484814
some of the scenes strike a deep chord, and some simply leave the reader feeling lost.	train	12922551
i only finished it because travelling and had no wifi access at the time to download another book.	train	21934498
i can't wait to read about the other brothers.	train	25423130
then there is cal who is charming and not interesting in min at all only taking her out to dinner because of a bet, but her keeps going back for more of her mean attitude and her fantastic shoes which he was a little obsessed over.	train	1616066
i spent the whole book trying to figure out what pia was and why her mom was so worried about her keeping it a secret.	train	14524855
all in all it was a good one time read.	train	24490654
nicola yoon wrote this stunning book so beautifully and it's story is so unique that you'll be thinking about it for days after you read it!!	train	26540216
either tell and deal with the consequences, or don't tell and buckle up buttercup!	train	21513895
i love the bad boy person's of both the dad & cade, but how they can easily be brought down by ana.	train	25888071
and camden....ugh so passionate, so intense, so sexy, and yet scary as hell sometimes.	train	21799599
a little slow i enjoy the story but compared to others in the series it was a little slow.	train	24453790
but when alec brand steps into the picture everything changes in her world.	train	24663470
as the cubs uncle is about to attack her the sheriff and itan ty shows up.	train	32011648
the highlight of the book to me was beth and jennifer's friendship - it was so well written and honest.	train	13785503
"you make them with broken pieces."""	train	43145292
however, the quest involves a fallen star that somehow is inside a person (gemma).	train	26517464
there should be internet sites dedicated to it.	train	41391574
this was another scorcher from laura kaye.	train	24034716
very witty and enticing!	train	41113081
much like lauren blakely's no regrets series, night after night steers away from more traditional contemporary romance stories, adding a bit of danger and suspense to the mix.	train	27349328
i emphasize these points because anna does.	train	7168450
i found the concept new and interesting.	train	26517464
the distance between us has no distance between me and it--it was simply fantastic.	train	20938637
i was hoping his romance with samantha would cheer him up.	train	25273781
but hunter's acceptance of everything seemed disjointed.	train	23845708
he's reliable, nice, supportive and protective.	train	25423130
ana is desired more than just by christian and through vivid detail, the reader gets the see what it could be like to be approached by someone who has feelings for you although those feelings are not reciprocated.	train	16813814
van's character, as well as all the others, were so well developed, their motivations and intentions clear and the plot rolled along seamlessly and tugged at my heart strings until the very last word.	train	9100833
-the plot of this book was pretty creative, and really fun to read about.	train	10551409
jet is a sweet, sexy, hilarious and protective character, and i just really loved him.	train	23682783
i couldn't immediately continue with the next book as i needed some time to process what happened.	train	10706553
"when it's good, kara... it's beautiful."""	train	16441531
i also wasn't completely comfortable with the way rafe pushed her.	train	42905438
overall it was enjoyable, had a few sad moments that tugged at you.	train	7162394
their relationship pushes all the right romance buttons, but as i said before, much of this book is about relationships other than theirs'.	train	10379217
i loved the whole scrapbook effect.	train	10261814
** spoiler alert ** beware, spoilers ahead.	train	3222389

it is such a fun, quick, and easy read.	train	3220771
but seriously... excellent book.	train	7168450

then she does something so spectacular to come out of the darkness that it made me cry for the significance of it.	train	44908160
drugs somehow coating the words and getting into my bloodstream.	train	26473363
there are exceptions, of course chase is certainly the most mysterious, and a fascinating and complex individual.	train	24942717
and i absolutely adored that when the truth came out it wasn't this big betrayal of confidence and the major issue in the story.	train	19113823
final conclusion: allyson makes very dumb choices as lulu, but i would have loved a book about plain old allyson.	train	17992862
this is actually the best story for me.	train	14515040

very predictable(especially in the beginning) but also interesting, not bad enough to have me putting the book down(there is enough to keep you going in here).	train	41391574

at first, i was disappointed, because i loved hearing the story from drew's point of view, and didn't think kate's would be as entertaining as his was.	train	25205902
this is a subject close to bella's heart after she experienced this herself.	train	41155464

i received a complimentary copy of this book in exchange for my honest review, which originally appeared on andi's book reviews.	train	6611698
my only complaint is that this book was very short and i wanted to know more about dash & lily after i finished the last page.	train	10551409
along with it, the writing of many of the personal interactions is stilted and awkward almost to the point of distraction.	train	21773809

this is the kind of heart-wrenching book that will make your chest hurt while you are reading it.	train	25959792
this book is such a cute chick-lit book.	train	3220771
only at 30% and i cant stop laughing jeez louise this book is hilarious so far !	train	21365702
the last chapters were worth the wait, though, and i'll definitely be finishing the series.	train	20397129

i can't image not buying my own furniture (but i'm not wealthy, either.)	train	634333
the book is told by emiline, and in the beginning, i was worried that i wouldn't connect with her.	train	43082751
as much as i feel that i'm leaning for team ash, again for once, i can't help but be torn as well for puck.	train	6838626
i cried when dumbledore died (yes, i did), and got really sad when edward left bella, but this was something else.	train	943470
it was very descriptive and the characters were interesting and charming.	train	1823891
and even beyond the sexual intimacy they shared, they have an emotional and intellectual connection/bond.	train	25197486
the characters may be young (they are in college) but the themes and situations here are not appropriate for many teens.	train	16441531

although i like the dream hunter books i still prefer the dark hunter ones.	train	81223
it is emotional.	train	25697736
warning: though the nuzzling isn't so omnipresent as in meyers's opening novel (so it's much less a distraction from the plot, though the desire is still major), the couple has intercourse in the first novel, though the sex isn't explicit.	train	6244926
funny, smart and sexy.	train	11164541
i think this is the best way to read a contemporary -- from both lead characters, because then it feels really real how they actually find and grow to love each other.	train	15093690
tristan and aimee's story gets better and deeper.	train	42251640
the kindness that she treated richard really was commendable.	train	49566885
it's wes, with his art and quiet strength that intrigues her the most.	train	1032900
this led me to one important question: why keep making the same mistake over and over and over and over and over again?	train	21569082
my first nicholas sparks book was true believer.	train	2416287
and there is a love interest, a first class alpha male brody who is also a mystery writer.	train	3038377
also, man, can she write a love scene ... even if they don't get down to business so to speak.	train	40728160
it's a cliched chick lit novel, and while i did find it funny, it was not unique enough or interesting enough to stand above the chick-lit crowd.	train	982677
if you are looking for a light, funny and enjoyable contemporary romance with no offensive misogynistic bull*hit i think this is a good one!	train	24673151
joe and alex have been involved in an online relationship .... but joe has been pretending to be his brother eric.	train	48249357
overall: it was cute, flirty, heart wrenching, and definitely heart warming.	train	41225554
however, though normally i prefer much more romance in a book like this, it was still a 5 star read for me, and i look forward to continuing to read about kirk and flynn's progress in the next book.	train	25264357
you simply can't help falling in love with these men and this story.	train	15573904

i'll even read this one again and i don't usually do that.	train	21912533

i would have preferred a stronger leading lady, but i still think gabrielle was a great character.	train	690332

like most of nora roberts' series' it follows the same format which makes it a bit predictable.	train	26233574
either way, the writing was good as always, but i did think there were some things unresolved so i'm going with 3 stars.	train	46829059

i'm going to reread this book when i'm older and have a family just to remind myself that nothing is perfect and there is no way of knowing if it's the right path or not - you just have to put your mind to it.	train	25391048
this book was intriguing but didn't satisfy me as a romance or a fantasy...there wasn't enough detail about the world & why some of the population were enslaved...also, i found daniel's 'mis-behaviour' difficult to understand given that he wasn't actively chaffing at his enslavement & seem 'well trained' to obedience...this needed more extrapolation imo...another disappointment was the abruptness of the ending...i was very surprised that after essentially 98% of the book being a set up to daniel's eventual (happy) surrender to master, it was all over too quickly for satisfaction.	train	14888582
review will be completed asap.	train	17178163

my review 5 out of 5 stars this book was like no other faerie book i have read, my first impression was that i love the way she sets the story.	train	21770941
i feel like i just read this same story in four other books recently from the fighter/sweet girl dominant male sex story.	train	43284129
and woooooweeeeeee, when they hit that next level-watch out.	train	13516569
this book had a couple of steamy scenes, but overall was a good book!	train	13600808
recommended.	train	16837919
i'm very mad at this book.	train	45626387
the author skipped large chunks of time, which didn't help.	train	21819891
good pool read and better written that i'd expected but there were so many times i wanted to reach through the page, smack ellen, and say grow the hell up.	train	1470370
but not much more than that.	train	5674279

unfortunately i wasn't as enamored when it came to the actual reading of it and like i said that might have just been timing.	train	46062694
cleo and adrian only had actual sex in the last parts of the book and by that time it already felt, at least for me, forced and more of a necessity, something to appease readers like me who got bored with all the foreplay.	train	42457904
it was a nice set-up.	train	23640341

what if the girl knew exactly what she is doing?	train	21891713
i had trouble connecting with this heroine and her actions and motivations were just somewhat strange.	train	19172694

ana may not be my favourite fictional heroine (in fact she is way down on the list) but i was pleased that she isn't quite the doormat that she first appears to be.	train	15732562
2.75 stars not bad, per se, but the story took a lot of short corners, spanning a long period of time and only quickly narrating the naughty bits (which were good!)	train	15915779
fun, happy read.	train	17034070
maybe because the characters, though the novel is too short, are also well-constructed.	train	56551386
if you can handle the naughty bits (ahem), then don't miss out on fifty shades!	train	15732562
once i started reading the story, i was both disappointed and pleasantly surprised by the dark tale and doomed romance that ms. murphy wrote.	train	41275687
we already new he was going to lose from the begining, since he was thinking about her from the start.	train	24987583

she's the kind of positive ya character young adults need, because she doesn't let the trolls win (yes she has self-doubt, but find me a person alive who doesn't) but she's mostly really positive, her body is her body, her hair is her hair, etc and i just wanted to scream with happiness for that.	train	44811118

this book is about a college girl looking for a internship for a job and she is asked to fill in to do a interview for a friend of hers she has to interview a millionaire for the college paper which turns into a romantic interest for the girl but it turns into a relationship of a different kind that involves spanking bondage and restraints and in other words its a dominant and submissive relationship which involves agreeing and signing of a contract that the submissive has to follow but she (submissive) want to change some of the terms which he (the dominant) has no choice but to agree with since he's become infatuated (obsessed) over her because she is innocent (a virgin) and he's actually falling in love with her which is a absolute first for him since all his other partners were just submissive and he didn't had any real feeling for any of them but his first experience in the world of bondage (where he was the submissive and she was the dominant) which plays a roll in the second book if i figured it out correctly which wired him to not fall in love (except with her) and she has to make a decision if she wants to continue this warped relationship or decide that its not for her decide to make the contract null and void (she decided to not make her decision until she sees him with his inhibitions gone and she allows him to have his way with her in a act of bondage which turns army and she then makes her final decision) believe it or not i actually enjoyed reading this book not just for the bondage sex scenes but because her innocence was so pure (not just because she was a virgin) but because she had a daring/naughty side too her with some things she decides to do to tease him (with wearing no panties on a date with him which catches him off guard) which actually cracked me up and just the relationship between them is different not because of the sub and dom part but wit the dom actually slowly but surely falling irrevocably in love with her and he doesn't want to lose her but he decides to do might cause her to do just that i didn't see much of the movie but the parts did see were interesting but i also heard that the portrayal of sub and dom wasn't shown correctly what happened in the movie with the roles doesn't actually happen in real life and they didn't like the movie because of that and other things which might've of tied into the roles also that which i don't know of that was the general consensus i heard about from other people that seen the movie thats all i heard about they are also making the second book into a movie ill probably try to read the other two books before i see the movie if i can actually read the lost of books before the movie comes out (i have quite a list of books to read through first)	train	15732562

i wasn't particularly invested in the mcs individually or them as a couple (unless their relationship develops in the next books of the series i'm not really convinced they had feelings towards each other beyond affectionate-friends-with-really-nice-benefits), but the worldbuilding and the plot were interesting and quite engaging, so i'm curious about what will happen in this 'verse next.	train	45124023

glad to have read it in between heavier texts.	train	24089046

book #41 of 2010 i've read a few katie macalister books and sometimes her humor is just a little bit off for me... it seems too forced for me to find it really funny.	train	6676256
while cleaner (sexually) than r. s. grey's other books it is definitely not clean.	train	47207959

obviously he's no longer living, but she has a bust of him that she talks to about her life and inner thoughts.	train	16646043
the story seemed draggy because of so much narrative, but really i think it was more the lack of true climax.	train	43144598
she bought the house and discovered that not only it had been the house of dahlia lamotte, a novelist whose books had been about young girls with no parents that ended up in the hands of byronic heroes who threatened their virginity, but that the house came with unpublished novels and a secret that changer her world: there was a succubus in that house, one that somehow, had visited her when she was little after losing her parents and told her fairytales to help her sleep.	train	16370337
even though i had a general idea of how this book was going to end, it still took me by surprise when it ended.	train	25119780
admittedly, i read reviews after i finish a book before i write my review to see what other people thought.	train	26177769
sweet and sexy story.	train	49165848
i normally hate love triangles, but this was a good one.	train	42391494

gabby was hardly a vain woman, but after meeting matt she begins to spend much more time on her looks, something elliot has never really encouraged.	train	25142244
it showed a unique mix of poignancy, romance, and humor.	train	15716159
the secret was morbid and the changes and eventual return to guy just felt forced and rather silly.	train	44752216
the characters were annoying sometimes and i couldn't really connect with them cause i didn't really got to know them, i felt it was a bit superficial sometimes.	train	15319502
subtle tone inflections turned clay from an almost aggravating character to one i could sympathize with.	train	47327338

blurb: 18 year old beauty and coffee shop worker, mia, is approached by a handsome customer after her car breaks down outside the shop.	train	25798784
she's quirky and a little neurotic, and so very relatable.	train	15546389
who would like this book: again, romantic comedy!	train	43082859
this can be read as a standalone novel and it has a hea.	train	26484632
otherwise, very heartwarming and enjoyable.	train	21397626
how could such a smart boy possibly go wrong?	train	3873004
it's twilight 2.0, twilight for adults.	train	15732562
it's going to take a few years and a new fad for those comparisons to stop (if at all... i don't find books being comparing to twilight near as often these days).	train	42299571
totally had the right to make ryan sweat a little.	train	44697471
so i very discreetly tried to get to that scene while at my desk but it was no use, the book just got better and better.	train	41275687
the sexual chemistry between maggie and gil!oh my!!	train	24962477
they are so cute together and her mom is soooo crazy and familiar that you can't not love her (the same goes to her dad).	train	6654033
on her first night in town she attends a vampire bar with her roommate anna.	train	23541181
ultimately, i think this book is getting more of a bad rep than it deserves.	train	15732562
dawson was never really developed.	train	25431684
this novel is a snappy page turner with oodles of sizzle in the sexy time department.	train	21678098
there's references to charlotte and abby being 25 and them having an entire system between them with references to the thundercats cartoon.	train	53514502
she did a fine job creating and describing characterizations, just felt like too much of the book was predictable.	train	19101279
don't bet on this book!!	train	26320980
i adored this one!	train	25324435
my only real complaint is i would have liked it to have been longer.	train	26138614

she's waiting to get kicked out, dragged out by security and blacklisted from all media companies in the west coast, but for some reason, it never happens.	train	49757741
in a way, it seemed like the villains of the piece got rewarded more than the h/h.	train	892826
another great story about the truths of being a teen, with some extra drama thrown in for good measure.	train	42916962
even with those deeper situations going on, there was a lot of fun in the book, some characters that you couldn't help but smile at, and some light hearted banter back and forth that balanced the book out well.	train	25272072
i love rainbow rowell, and this book was fine, but this is not my favorite of hers.	train	25391048
well, we get to find out in this parallel story to last year's favorite - confessions of a jane austen addict.	train	13351031

they both seemed like hot messes.	train	25391048
this is my first time reading a book by this author and i really enjoyed it.	train	49731094
i really wish there was some sort of future take showing what happened to these two as i would love to know.	train	18529702
then he kills a bunch of people and disappears.. 4.	train	7188482
the story is what i really loved about this book.	train	2112553
meanwhile, steam & sorcery was an absolute hoot!	train	15470426
referencing the word 'just' because it's another pet peeve that i can overlook- it's in the book 422 times!	train	25391048
i guess it felted a little rushed, and it definitely didn't pack the emotional punch i expected.	train	44826021
-- random: i can't help but find some re-used elements of this book from fangirl.	train	25391048
there were a couple editing issues with the book, though.	train	42093893
it was nice and short so it was a quick read.	train	41326535
i really enjoyed wilder's mate, it was an interesting spin on a paranormal romance for me and i was glad i finally read it.	train	13516569

also desmond, the child she cares for a few days a week.	train	26648958
i can sympathize and empathize with the 2 lovers and even though the book is trashy, it could be used to start interesting conversations about love relationships and what independence, codependence, interdependence look like.	train	15732562
especially all the scenes concerning lottie and ben's wedding night experience.	train	21865617
this was a great lot of fun to read!	train	19018761
this was also a very quick read.	train	23580839
and regardless of his flaws, he is an honorable man and he wouldn't do that to his wife, even if he was thinking of getting an annulment at that point.	train	24998499

"""eligible"" was definitely an entertaining and enjoyable book."	train	26428236
i devoured this in one day!	train	26123646
the problem is that his goal is very noble, so i felt bad about hating him.	train	18256423
the outcast, shy and timid.	train	26619632
the commentary on the social classes was interesting and truthful and the male viewpoint was sensitive but masculine, which is a difficult mix to get correct and can sometimes seem too feminine.	train	13593837
but it was hard for betsy, too.	train	14527780
his wife left him.	train	25739112
brilliant and refreshing :)	train	13593837
it lured me in with its contemporary design and hooked me with that blurb.	train	44979793
parts of it are completely unreal, like the first sex scene, where anastasia, the girl who has never been aroused before, never touched herself, has an orgasm after a little foreplay, and then another after a couple of minutes of sex.	train	15732562
and if she does, will she still love what she finds?	train	15732562
wedding night combines and interweaves two story lines and is told in the alternating voice of these two sisters, showing their different perspectives.	train	21865617
but well written for what it is.	train	293701
with that said, it's a quick read (took me about 2 hours) and kept me entertained for the most part.	train	24987583
it really was an enjoyable read with plenty of hot smokin sex in it and humor to boot.	train	24797236
"he left home at fifteen for no reason except teenage rebellion so i still not sure how his sisters got ""taken"" for him."	train	15154888
"brogan starr is apparently the antichrist but when lainey finally gets the chance to meet him and see him interact with his employees it's obvious that maybe he really isn't the ""devil""."	train	49757741
i can see why some readers found fault with this modern p&p retelling.	train	26428236

"later on, she reframes her charge, stating, ""it is very easy to say things like that when temptation has never crossed your path."""	train	25142244
second, i was not excited by the dynamic between lily and alec.	train	46822469
then it turns into an introspection of privileged versus not so privileged lives and how we all have problems.	train	25191710
it's so bad.	train	45626387
so, to sum it up...i liked it but didn't love it.	train	14061645
for the most part.	train	21393665
i'm a fan of quinn's earlier books but still will read each new release.	train	2907783

i really liked julien and hoped he was a good guy.	train	18982484
anyway, i loved this book as much as her other novels.	train	2417683
as for kyle, at times he seems a bit clueless...or maybe naive is a better word.	train	44811118
he was right there in front of me, running with his surfboard into the waves.	train	21383954
plus, he is a cop and pretty damn good in the sack, at least the way the love scenes are written out, it sure as hell sounds like he would is!	train	23892018

i was 5 pages in.	train	19137078
it was like they were saying all the scripted words but it wasn't quite written to get me totally sucked into the story from the start.	train	3961605
i didn't see how he changed or how she knew she he changed.	train	41253597
but there is risk taking and there is stupidity.	train	50722427
all she had to do was get there.	train	51163439
in fact, the first 8-10 chapters of the book were so tough to get through, i couldn't... until a month or so ago when i discovered i had a lot of time behind the wheel and an audible subscription.	train	15732562
regardless of my issues, the billionaire's favorite mistake is sure to delight fans of the series who have been waiting patiently for greer and asher's story and those who love a good friend to lover romance that indulges itself with plenty of laughter and heat.	train	47815228

the scenes we hot and i was fanning myself through most of them.	train	8498290

this was defiantly not.	train	19076887
not bad, but not as good as the first.	train	14347737
i don't usually like books like these and i have no idea what attracted me to read this one, but i just loved it.	train	18067012
all in good fun of course.	train	15732562
secondary characters: we have here a lot of good characters who have their stories in separate books.	train	24171562
so, i'm not going to say much about the storyline.	train	28096033
great read, tough topic, i devoured it.	train	25325159
this book was office romance at its finest.	train	38542565

suddenly panicking about the idea of day-care when you're 8 months pregnant (because everyone around you was being pregnant, so hey, you should definitely get pregnant too) means you did not think things through, made no research in the facilities around you, and so forth.	train	25391048

but the writing and the beginning of the story really pulled me in so i kept reading.	train	45224545
well....okay.	train	15732562
horrible writing, bad plot, terrible characters.	train	298324
consequently, the story goes through the usual tired machinations of telling (not much showing in this novel) me that raina loves kittens, and puppies and adorable orphaned waifs. (	train	1814449
sadly it felt like it was more of a marathon to how much smut could be fitted into the story, than the love itself between the characters.	train	19027974

it was a very easy read.	train	49288333
it's trite, insulting, and dangerous.	train	15732562

definitely worth reading!	train	25391048

huge, large, thick, long, small, etc... are all good, but put away the tape measure.	train	23628313

for me, the book kind of dragged in the first 1/3-1/2 of the book, and then the plot moved forward better after that.	train	25391048
it was fluffy and easy to read, but the dialogue was over-the-top and cheesy, and the romance pining between dave and julia was boring.	train	42299571

at first i couldn't help but compare it to the parasol protectorate series by gail carriger because the story starts off with the hero stepping onto land from a dirigible, and it didn't compare favorably because carriger's books are more fun and funny, but as soon as the hero arrived in the heroine's neighborhood and finally met her i was able to view this book more along its own merits, and it's not bad.	train	15943231
the vocabulary was seventh grade at best, the plot had me cringing between the numerous times christian and ana had sex and i was not engaged at all with them as well as the many descriptions of ana's inner goddess i would have overlooked the grammatical errors if it i was running into this...all the time while she was speaking....and everything single..sentence had them interspersed.	train	15732562
but on the other hand this is one of its very few positives; you can speed-read it and never feel lost.	train	15732562

4 stars i love this book and i will read it again several times this other brings the spice the romance the hatred are all in this book.	train	56556476
but then i remember that grayson in such a rush did a pretty despicable thing, and i forgave him for that, so i'm willing to overlook sam's inappropriate behavior, especially after he made his own (would-be) sacrifice for bailey's sake.	train	21531210

the title, flight lessons, was the only one in the book rack that i found even remotely interesting.	train	1575388
i went into this book thinking how could there be a happily ever after, and in the traditional sense no this book doesn't give you that, it showcases a relationship between master and slave, about pushing boundaries to the their limits to free inner desires.	train	11221308
so once i seen a cover teasing me with that sort of eye candy, of course i had to have it.	train	16370337
but i warn you not to.	train	25391048
i am a little obsessed with the whole rockabilly style (see my pinterest board here) since reading this book; for me i think this is the most awesome compliment i can give jennifer echols - maybe - for getting me hooked on rockabilly style ;) (i think it suits me anyway :p ) the story is intensely emotional it gets beneath the skin of the characters and into their heads and their hearts.	train	21531210
this author will never stop surprising me, because c'mon, (light spoiler alert) only rainbow rowell would describe in detail a pug giving birth to its children.	train	25391048

it made me cry.	train	25697042
but there were so many pages and pages of obscure football references that only the most devoted football fans would have appreciated, and (not to generalize) most hardcore football fans are probably not also the type to read chick-lit romance novels.	train	26123646

i was ellie in that moment.	train	26412251
god i hated her.. not only because i was a fan of the other team right from the start-go mia- but mostly because she was a weak, pathetic, klingy and needy woman who let a pregnancy happen with someone who didn't love her and at points not even like her.. i can not believe she was so infatuated with ridge who was being a mega-asshole to her by the way, and acted like oh well let's become a big happy family.. she never thought about the unjustice she will be forcing to this baby eventually.. i really think it was a ploy to keep him near her and nothing more for her.. the story is told through ridge's eyes and that was very nicely done.. he is a dark character in love with the wrong woman and he sends her away in hopes of a reconcilliation with his big brother.. from that point his life get's even worse.. but mia is always there loving him.. overall the book is solid, a bit kinky, sad at times and very very interesting.. the characters have issues and they struggle a lot but there is a ray of hope in the end.. actually more than just that.. they deserved it!	train	27231423

i didn't get into the characters' minds, i didn't get into the story itself, and i especially did not understand the approach the author(s) used with this story.	train	41825968
like no way could this really be the ending, the whole book seemed to give different tangents and you come up with this?	train	45221017

this book will make you laugh out loud a lot and draw you in from the very first page!!	train	44070863

the point, presumably, is to introduce a sense of danger, but the rapid fire arrival of two unknown antagonists splits the reader's attention; it's jarring and disorganized.	train	24584386

however, it should be noted that this is the first book in the series, so things could become more fluid as the series continues.	train	16840072
i might not go as far as to recommend this book, but it would probably appeal to many 12-15 year olds who are cutting their teeth romantically speaking (ie, have not actually had a real romantic relationship).	train	18660611
i found this book completely delightful.	train	21678206

the most disappointing part, for the mild feminist within me, was to see how easily she falls into his mind games, like a mosquito on a spiderweb, while he's comfortable playing around with the gray areas between what is supposed to be right and wrong - per se- to slowly mold her to his convenience and turn her into merely a puppet of his desires.	train	15732562

maybe more, since it has some steamy scenes sprinkled throughout!	train	49037580
who drained the pacific ocean?	train	19697036
it was badly written and badly edited and i wouldn't read anything by this author again.	train	18367389
that scene was not needed at all.	train	21732686
happily, that wasn't the case here at all.	train	24176656
and by the way, i would have been a lot more pissed off with her than gavin for how things went down... but i digress.	train	16213001
i personally could not get into this book.	train	15732562
in fact, she knows nothing, and yet she has a son already?	train	25121756
3.5/4 a totally awkward love story was a super cute, realistic depiction of teens and sex.	train	26485606
but i am not an expert on the subject and it's not as integral a part of the book as i had first expected based on the blurb.	train	57767021

the twists and turns and general kinkiness of the books really make for an interesting read.	train	21440609
their sexual chemistry....which is off the charts hawt!!	train	21573878
as a result, she shuns strangers and never performs in public.	train	12384797
it wasn't completely non-existent, but in my opinion we're given more a promise than anything substantial, with mere glimpses of something stronger - but that something never actually shows itself.	train	6242865
there was lots of well-written action, and many great relationships were developed throughout the course of the book.	train	27181799

when it all happen, i felt like i was the one being let go.	train	18067012
the writing just felt a bit off- that character a bit too stiff and unnatural.	train	41825968
the ridiculousness of the decisions and actions at the end didn't fit with the rest of the book.	train	26864924
even though she could technically have anything she wanted, she was deprived of one thing she crave the most - her freedom.	train	44381849
all in all, the infinite moment of us just wasn't for me.	train	23912412

so i was surprised when i found myself completely engaged in the story.	train	19014858
and pretty graphic too.	train	14167525
what's that all about?	train	25256806
but like i said before, i wanted the author to go more into it.	train	26619632
i also would have liked the ending to be a bit more fleshed out, or an epilogue for pete's sake - why do we read p&p variations?	train	25271296
th author writes about tough social issues such as abuse, slavery and gender inequality.	train	21398563
review to come.	train	15732562
i had to know!	train	50761853
it's one of those stories that just flow so easily.	train	2255595
i will have to say though, that this book is written in a stream-of-consciousness type of way an can be confusing sometimes.	train	24935674
i liked reyes as a character - the assassin with scruples.	train	6580107
the characters are something though.	train	3873004
this was just too much fun.	train	25146450
okay - i was ready for some fluff and a bit of heated sex and you'd think with character names like: ofelia (and did i mention she is a stripper?)	train	40848215

the entire book is about how two people 'should be together' but 'aren't together' and god knows why but the entire college seems to 'want them together'.	train	40145315
i see that the arcs refer to a lot of quotes that weren't in my copy of the book, and i'm happy to see that the author took a lot of them out.	train	26163493
to know that someone dealt with these issues, it felt liberating to know that others deal with stressors like this.	train	26167886
yes bailey is in love with angel while engaged to carron.	train	24347326
that was really the only thing that seemed to bug me about her character, but i suppose we can chalk it up to her being enchanted with this dude and hope she fairs better with her male counterpart in the next book.	train	16370337
it is a light read and it gives you that happy, warm feeling which you need sometimes.	train	18529702
so, like i said, i had a difficult time getting into this book but once i did i flew through it.	train	19046222
not really and mob/mafia romance, it has some mention of it but the main characters are not involved in it.	train	19050069
so only two stars but i still recommend the first novel.	train	15943231

i had just started it and before i know, i was done reading!	train	28176862

this might have been something to explore in joe's character arc through the novel, but since it isn't, i think it was just something lacking in the character himself.	train	25423166

there was also something about the witch that had me guessing what her motivation was for doing this, she didn't really seem to be gaining anything from it, they just both lived in the castle, and rapunzel did not like her at all, so what was the point?	train	19256962
i liked caden as a narrator, he was especially conflicted in what was expected of him, he didn't like lying.	train	47243315

4.5-- i thoroughly enjoyed this book as i did with the other books by smith.	train	24813023
and although the 'secret' was so easy to guess (i knew i'd wished the heroine to be smarter), the pace was so good it's a page turner.	train	40816553

he literally threatened multiple women in the book and we were supposed to like him?	train	36123954
however that being said this is why you should get this book immediately this author makes you feel like you are one or more of her characters and those you aren't you feel like they are your friends or family.	train	25938681
one of my favourites!	train	42438616
the scene in the truck while in alaska on the way to the glacier.	train	26694375
i mean i knew the chosen one crap was coming since she was mari the awaited, so duh.	train	423977
their past and present pain is very accessible, so ashley's wonderful ability to draw the reader into a scene and spur emotional involvement is on full display here.	train	18115826
i mean, jeez, what a bummer.	train	295059
the deal is about a music major, hannah wells.	train	44100599
at the end i understood why she did it though, and it only brought out how deep emme's issues were.	train	25310378
and that excitement carries through the entire book, never a dull moment!	train	23876664
maybe my hunch is wrong and these things will be addressed appropriately in the next book, but i kind of doubt it.	train	19186128
i wanted to break his neck.	train	21544272

i wanted something fun and light and this book delievered.	train	6694705

now that she see's what she could have with killian, life throws her another sucker punch and she risks losing the one person who has always believed in her.	train	49409628
he's just a vibrating bundle of nerves for much of this book you just knew it was all going to have to come to a head and it does spectacularly.	train	25378388
great story line and characters!	train	15911884
okay this book would get more than 5 stars if possible!	train	19038910
she radiated love and wasn't bogged down by the responsibilities of it all... well, she had her moments, but who wouldn't.	train	42495691
there's still too many unanswered questions (and, frankly, i haven't gotten enough of connor rogan yet!).	train	47472732
as in so many amy lane books, i loved the depth of characterisation here.	train	21568953

i too would have loved being in his head, especially after his penis head moment.	train	24852550
enjoyed reading about keen and his mate, true to themselves and each other.	train	42462087
chloe is awkward but endearing and boyd just understands her and things click between them.	train	53149007
i'm too busy sobbing and hugging my kindle.	train	26419682
what prevented me from giving this a 5star rating because of how it ended.	train	24065237
but somewhere in the middle, i started losing the connection i felt.	train	28402852
he also had some of the best one-liners which only added to his awesomeness.	train	25732130
it is totally good!	train	21587145
- p. 38 how the conflict was resolved in the end was a bit predictable, which led me to reflect on historical romance stories set in scotland and feature highlanders.	train	18588471
it was too much.	train	24878172
killer cliffhanger.	train	21930423

bossman didn't disappoint.	train	50572087
again..i want to confess my undying love for the genius that is colleen hoover...this book, though different than the usual coho story, it still possessed words that connect you to the tale and grip your heart so tight you can't remember what is real and what is fiction.	train	42099145

so quick and easy to read yet so enjoyable they aren't my favourite couple - that goes to woods and della (because well woods is just ...) but i love still absolutely adore them and this book!	train	24956525
definitely a recommendation for those who are ready to take a dip into your feels and explore the uncanny hope of the unknown and the exciting thrill of the to-be-seen.	train	51457865
i don't know how or when it happened, but i started picturing every moment with you.	train	19168097
these awkward encounters give her even more to ponder over.	train	46182388
i fell in love with condrad and i was smiling when i was reading his thoughts.	train	12901545

ohhh i actually liked this book.	train	28402852
it was really interesting and gave me the feels (which is typical for a hoover book).	train	42099145
if not for the book happening in the same time frame as the first book, i would have given the story 4 stars.	train	21890308
but it also had the hottest sex.	train	18115826
"4 ""forver linked"" stars my first book by this author and it was so good!"	train	55568489
that is all.	train	42410243
more secrets were revealed, more connections were exposed, and even more questions were raised.	train	41142458
and we all know that where john goes, blay and quinn are sure to follow.	train	7370233
we make it complicated and make it in to a mixed emotion.	train	594714
jim suffers a lot in his battle against devina, but he is determined and fierce.	train	14428619

but layken, honey, listen to your own words and then listen to will's.	train	19038910
as much as i knew what ridge and sydney were doing was wrong but i couldn't help but support it, their love is real and genuine and once you find something as amazing as that, you simply can't let it go.	train	24878180
i really enjoyed it, i would love to have a part 3.	train	40018073

i was on the edge of my seat every time they were in the same room with each other, wondering how far the author would go before they finally got together.	train	23981243
they way ella deals with her struggles and disabilities, how she faces her new family and deals with how they treat her.	train	42254560
he became what tess needed all along as well as the man he has wanted to be from the beginning.	train	26026261

happy reading!	train	42750148
the sex scenes were lacking and few and far between...the action was missing and it just jumped to the end... the end was a cliff hanger as you can imagine and well know after 3 other books...i guess we will wait and see how zz will do	train	25123821
the very first sentence of the paper swan captured my attention and i felt a rush of excitement anticipating a great story.	train	45649527
there relationship started out back ass wards and is still screwed up.	train	19186128
nah uh hah, no such a thing here.	train	1605350
i seriously adored this book, lukas may have ruined me for any of the other males in either series, and though i am kicking myself for not starting on this series earlier, i figure it's better late than never :)	train	44445086
jodi, thank you for giving me lots and lots of magnificent pages that made me laugh, cry, and scream in frustration.	train	23847880
as much as you loved zeth, you will equally love rebel.	train	43249160
i feel like i might be missing a little bit of the entire story but not enough to confuse me.	train	16470051
i also loved how one by one ally was able to win over all the hot bunch and that they did what they could to help her.	train	21447897
dirty was written in the form of 4 povs and don't get me wrong, i love pov formatting style.	train	40701519
this series is worth reading.	train	19260000

it's cute, funny, quick & if you haven't read the first book in the series go and read it!!!	train	21407596
not in the obnoxious way, but in the completely adorable way.	train	21880254
skip ahead a number of years a things have changed.	train	42901335
it's like the genres are meant to be.	train	21587145
it's a journey in discovering yourself, love, and standing up and fighting to protect those you love as well as yourself.	train	27680058
i could not put this one down!	train	2787065
through their self-awareness, you were able to see just how they rationalized the things they did, and i absolutely love that in characters.	train	42099145
and the little reunion with some people from other kristen ashley 's books made the story even better.	train	44870637
knox was the perfect alpha hero, strong and possessive with that hidden sweetness.	train	45140513
i too was not looking forward to smiley's story but im glad i got it.	train	42442372
he's just so wonderful!	train	21400430

one nigh ripper and danny's world change, danny didn't see the scars in ripper she saw the man underneath and ripper once again felt alive.	train	21932118
just like jude, the man that i pegged as a man unable to change his ways, to really believe his own words and not be able to be part of the world.	train	54006379
i understood where their minds were.	train	55568489
he has grown his empire with his loyal crew.	train	45140513
even with hannah's past she was so strong and willing to not only slay her own demons but also stephen's.	train	42438616
i won't choose one.	train	24346290
i don't even feel much towards this book other than disappointment mostly thanks to the ending since the beginning was so promising and then it suddenly all fell apart.	train	24510755
that was the last person i suspected.	train	23847880
i'm going to finish what i have of this series and read book #3, which i've been told is better.	train	25967560
so i feel like i have to preface all of my reviews for kristen ashley by saying i seem to love all her books, and i cannot put them down without devouring them first.	train	44870637
in the previous books of this series (which is one of my favorite series of m/m romance), they felt a great deal but didn't talk about it.	train	18447540
but he always had his reasons, none of them unwarranted.	train	42395146
definitely one of my favorite books of all time!	train	43940889
it also has them growing up and changes their lives for the better, and not for each other, but for themselves :) and there is drama and passion.	train	25482516
danika is such a sweetheart - she's refreshingly honest, sarcastic, sassy, a fantastic dancer and is like a breath of fresh air to tristan who is used to false, fake women.	train	24167516
i liked the first book better.	train	36410913
if you haven't read anything by ms. probst, and enjoy amazing contemporary romance, look no further!!!	train	42099151
i loved seeing the relationship between ellie and javier develop from start to finish.	train	23745831
i have questions, though, and look forward to book 4!	train	21411971
i also adored the fact that when the mystery finally started to unravel i myself started to remember all the small details and clues that were planned throughout the story for the reader to find -- the details that only now began to make sense to me!	train	40068387
cletus and jennifer are perfect for each other.	train	42897371
if you haven't read this series, about time to pick it up.	train	21935468
i mean, really, it was everywhere.	train	23577838
the sight of her paralyzes me.	train	21502991
it's not your typical romance but it's great for lovers of mc heroes with good hearts and strong heroines who can hold their own (which i adore!).	train	45599974
but i like how she's insecure.	train	21587145
i can hardly wait	train	16014010
the plot was kind of predictable but still enjoyable.	train	17763198
first, the use of lily's point of view only was the smartest and most accurate decision she has made.	train	43940889
i understand easton was dealt sh*t cards with an alcoholic mother, an absent father and no one understands or cares enough for easton to share his trouble - it's really sad.	train	51418871
once you start, you can't put it down.	train	1214837
kate is probably my favorite character.	train	42172145
revelations abound some conforming the suspicions set within the player while others were totally out of left field but made complete sense in the context of the plot.	train	51418871
we'll see if i can put words to how much i enjoyed this story, but right now i'm diving into book 2.	train	18588471
it's like my own life is out of my own reach.	train	21547521

a lot of 'babe', 'honey' and 'sugar'.	train	17276473
fun, funny, heart wrenching, frustrating, philosophical, sweet and sexy.	train	42897371
i don't mind weak characters, but i hate ones that complain about nothing.	train	16422
poor poor ryder!	train	25589246
jude is still that same hot headed boy who just loves luce more that life.	train	21904550
"he is quite frustrating with audrey because she refused to be scared and reacted differently from what he thought anyone in his ""cloak and dagger"" world, would react."	train	46003916
and she fought hard for both.	train	41130420
and she did... and he did (come for her - though it took 7 years to locate her).	train	21496528
or maybe, i just ached.	train	5164827
the characters are great.	train	41389236
the only similarity being that ella, like sara, seems to go for the guy that may be their downfall.	train	42440906
i am heartbroken, i wanted my happily ever after, high-school romance.	train	45800086
what i can say is that it certainly seems like this book is less dark, maybe because it's told from the pov of someone who wasn't describing gruesome details.	train	24075414
until jax was truly amazing and one of the very books that i have read.	train	44951930
but he proved to have a heart and showed his yearning for her love.	train	24749971
i did find meredith to be annoying after awhile; the way she went on and on whining about whether travis loved her or not when it was so obvious that he did.	train	18120890
alex is a damsel in distress disguised as a snarky girl from texas.	train	43506545
also the reasoning for the termination of their relationship when they were young was missed for me, and a bit on the blackmail side.	train	45290648
but yours were too much.	train	24886836
i wasn't even sure what it was about, only that i really like this author and have slowly been working my way through her backlist of books.	train	6828809
you are 20 freakin years old!	train	21880254
"still he could not like riding when she could not; the gentleman in him rankled at the idea. """	train	40897191
i think the following chapter shall be an interesting read, as well as maybe some laughs, due to the fact that eveline isnt quite sure what a wifes responsibilities completely entail -if you know what i mean -- the more i read, the more i fall in love with eveline.	train	18588471
i hated it, but i loved it.	train	17763198

prior comments 3.5 stars.	train	24095561
i like the concept of a anti-hero (we should have more of those) and i do have a thing for a bad boy... yet, some parts, if not more, was a bit boring.	train	15702803
i didnt expect it.	train	45217167
because of what caused it to be darker, i'm not sure the lighter, snarky stuff would have been appropriate.	train	13001065
also when reading the parents scene you could just tell the author is writing the parents as if they were british.	train	24946139
rush of course is hot, and torn between 2 women (blaire and nan his sister) i could just about forgive his earlier behaviour in the book as he more than made up for it later on (i may have melted and swooned at the same time).	train	21864517
this pisses me off.	train	18973111
plain and simple.	train	7288100
i would type in her name on facebook, instagram, goodreads just to see if she has anything in the works.	train	42804162
since then, he's been looking for the opposite of commitment and has become a bit of a player.	train	41246725
nevada baylor is a private eye working for the family business--baylor investigative agency.	train	47472732
the story line itself is also pretty far-fetched.	train	24075414
the one thing that drove me absolutely crazy and made it hard to get through the last 40% was the way the characters speak.	train	45357635
levi and evie are married with a three-year old son, evan.	train	52155134
millay writes with pure perfection at her fingertips, this is the perfect novel, written at the perfect time.	train	21547521
after that shock-worthy cliffhanger at the end of the darkest sunrise i have been on the edge of my seat in anticipation for this one, so you can imagine my surprise when i opened up my email and saw that this book was ready and waiting for me on my kindle (thank you aly martinez and the ladies at inkslinger pr).	train	55459800
jason has definitely been an intriguing side character throughout this series, so i was happy to read his book.	train	16186138
jump forward and millie runs into logan and just the sound of his voice stuns her and she feels compelled to explain to him what happened decades before.	train	43788815
the main characters are both easy to like and love.	train	45762345
the end of this book makes me really emotional because this trilogy was a part of my life .	train	21587145
it can be ugly at times, unfair, cruel but in the end when two people really love each other, they work through all of their issues.	train	24749971
but, i guess that is just wishful thinking on my part. ;)	train	12985451
the characters, really didn't interest me at all.	train	17969941
not only did the epilogue slay me, but this insight into shade's character was at times funny and heartbreaking.	train	44718572

she pushes mark away in order to keep him safe.	train	43119933
she gave as good as she got.	train	47314876

their story is ultimately heartbreaking but that is what you loved the most about the series.	train	49952681
this review was posted at under the covers we've been waiting for this moment for a long time.	train	16448859

camilla (swink) and dominic are so great together.	train	52978498
okay i understand she is devastated by the loss of her family but that is always her excuse and she is weak in comparison to the other breedmates in the series and i think her telling over and over that she was in the force is alittle repetitive.	train	7085183

twitch is sooooo messed up, and lexi should run in the opposite direction but they really are made for one another.	train	26129516
the story is graphic, gritty and leaves nothing to the imagination.	train	24581234
