If you've ever paid off one credit card with another, thrown out a bill before opening it, or convinced yourself that buying at a two-for-one sale is like makingmoney, then this silly, appealing novel is for you. In the opening pages of Confessions of a Shopaholic, recent college graduate Rebecca Bloomwood is offered a hefty line of credit by a London bank. Within a few months, Sophie Kinsella's heroine has exceeded the limits of this generous offer, and begins furtively to scan her credit-card bills at work, certain that she couldn't have spent the reported sums.
In theory anyway, the world of finance shouldn't be a mystery to Rebecca, since she writes for a magazine called Successful Saving. Struggling with her spendthrift impulses, she tries to heed the advice of an expert and appreciate life's cheaper pleasures: parks, museums, and so forth. Yet her first Saturday at the Victoria and Albert Museum strikes her as a waste. Why? There's not a price tag in sight.
It kind of takes the fun out of it, doesn't it? You wander round, just looking at things, and it all gets a bit boring after a while. Whereas if they put price tags on, you'd be far more interested. In fact, I think all museums should put prices on their exhibits. You'd look at a silver chalice or a marble statue or the Mona Lisaor whatever, and admire it for its beauty and historical importance and everything--and then you'd reach for the price tag and gasp, ""Hey, look how much this one is!"" It would really liven things up. 
Eventually, Rebecca's uncontrollable shopping and her ""imaginative"" solutions to her debt attract the attention not only of her bank manager but of handsome Luke Brandon--a multimillionaire PR representative for a finance group frequently covered in Successful Saving. Unlike her opposite number in Bridget Jones's Diary, however, Rebecca actually seems too scattered and spacey to reel in such a successful man. Maybe it's her Denny and George scarf. In any case, Kinsella's debut makes excellent fantasy reading for the long stretches between white sales and appliance specials. --Regina Marler","3-stars,5-stars,abandoned,adult-fiction,audio,audiobook,audiobooks,beach-read,beach-reads,book-club,book-to-movie,books,books-i-own,books-to-movies,borrowed,brain-candy,brit-lit,british,chic-lit,chick,chick-lit,chick-lit-romance,chiclit,comedy,contemporary,contemporary-fiction,contemporary-romance,currently-reading,default,did-not-finish,dnf,e-book,e-books,ebook,england,english,fashion,favorite,favorite-books,favorites,favourites,fiction,finished,first-in-series,fluff,for-fun,fun,funny,general-fiction,girly,girly-books,guilty-pleasures,have,hilarious,humor,humour,i-own,just-for-fun,kindle,kinsella,library-books,light-reading,light-reads,modern,movie,movies,my-books,my-bookshelf,my-library,novel,novels,on-my-shelf,own-it,owned,owned-books,paperback,part-of-a-series,re-read,read-2009,read-in-2010,read-in-2011,read-in-2012,read-in-2014,read-in-2015,read-in-english,realistic-fiction,romance,romantic-comedy,series,shopaholic,shopaholic-series,sophie-kinsella,tbr,to-buy,to-read,wish-list,women-s-fiction,womens-fiction,ya,young-adult","fiction,romance,young-adult",6160,Sophie Kinsella,3.74,2169284,165735.0,Shopaholic,12.0,555675,10488,3.620000000000001

BookPage calls Nicholas Sparks, ""a modern master of fateful love stories,"" and his phenomenal bestsellers- The Notebook, Message in a Bottle, and A Walk to Remember- have made him one of America's most beloved storytellers. Here, in his newest work, Sparks tells a story about making the greatest commitment of all...loving someone forever.
The Rescue
When confronted by raging fires or deadly accidents, volunteer fireman Taylor McAden feels compelled to take terrifying risks - risks no one else in the department would ever take - to save lives. But there is one leap of faith Taylor can't bring himself to make: He can't fall in love. For all his adult years, Taylor has sought out women who need to be rescued, women he leaves as soon as their crisis is over, as soon as the relationship starts to become truly intimate.
Then, one day, a raging, record-breaking storm hits his small Southern town. Denise Holton, a young single mother, is driving through it when her car skids off the road. With her is her four-year-old son, Kyle, a boy with severe learning disabilities and for whom she has sacrificed everything. Unconscious and bleeding, she-but not Kyle-will be found by Taylor McAden. And when she wakes, the chilling truth becomes clear to both of them: Kyle is gone.
During the search for Kyle, the connection, the lifeline, between Taylor and Denise takes root. Taylor doesn't know that this rescue will be different from all the others, demanding far more than raw physical courage. That it will lead him to the possibility of his own rescue from a life lived without love. That it will require him to open doors to his past that were slammed shut by pain. That it will dare him to live life to the fullest by daring to love.
In The Rescue Nicholas Sparks weaves his inimitable spell, immersing us in the passions and the surprising complexities of modern relationships-and in doing so, teaching us something about our own.","2000,2001,2012-reads,adult,adult-fiction,already-read,audio,audio-book,audio-books,audiobook,audiobooks,books-i-have,books-i-own,books-owned,books-to-buy,borrowed,chic-lit,chick-lit,chicklit,contemporary,contemporary-fiction,contemporary-romance,currently-reading,default,drama,e-book,e-books,ebook,ebooks,english,family,favorite,favorite-authors,favorite-books,favorites,favourites,fiction,finished,general-fiction,guilty-pleasures,hardcover,have,i-own,in-my-library,kindle,library,love,love-stories,love-story,made-me-cry,maybe,mine,my-books,my-bookshelf,my-favorites,my-library,mystery,n-sparks,need-to-buy,nicholas,nicholas-sparks,nicholas-sparks-books,nicolas-sparks,nook,novel,novels,on-kindle,on-my-shelf,other,own-it,own-to-read,owned,paperback,re-read,read-2014,read-in-2011,read-in-2012,read-in-2013,read-in-2014,realistic-fiction,relationships,romance,romance-novels,romantic,shelfari-favorites,southern,sparks,sparks-nicholas,stand-alone,standalone,sub,summer-reads,tear-jerker,tear-jerkers,the-rescue,to-buy,to-read,wish-list,women-s-fiction,womens-fiction,young-adult","fiction,mystery, thriller, crime,romance,young-adult",2345,Nicholas Sparks,4.06,4600277,,,,148062,3150,4.1

By all accounts, Simon Bassetis on the verge of proposing to his best friend's sister, the lovely--and almost-on-the-shelf--Daphne Bridgerton. But the two of them know the truth--it's all an elaborate plan to keep Simon free from marriage-minded society mothers. And as for Daphne, surely she will attract some worthy sutiors now that it seems a duke has declared her desirable.
But as Daphne waltzes across ballroom after ballroom with Simon, it's hard to remember that their courtship is a complete sham. Maybe it's his devilish smile, certainly it's the way his eyes seem to burn every time he looks at her... but somehow Daphne is falling for the dashing duke... for real! And now she must do the impossible and convince the handsome rogue that their clever little scheme deserves a slight alteration, and that nothing makes quite as much sense as falling in love...

But this time the gossip columnists have it wrong. Anthony Bridgerton hasn't just decided to marry--he's even chosen a wife! The only obstacle is his intended's older sister, Kate Sheffield--the most meddlesome woman ever to grace a London ballroom. The spirited schemer is driving Anthony mad with her determination to stop the betrothal, but when he closes his eyes at night, Kate's the woman haunting his increasingly erotic dreams...
Contrary to popular belief, Kate is quite sure that reformed rakes do notmake the best husbands--and Anthony Bridgerton is the most wicked rogue of them all. Kate's determined to protect her sister--but she fears her own heart is vulnerable. And when Anthony's lips touch hers, she's suddenly afraid she might not be able to resist the reprehensible rake herself...","1,19th-century,2016-reads,3-stars,4-stars,5-stars,adult,adult-fiction,adult-romance,all-time-favorites,alpha-male,audiobook,author-julia-quinn,books-i-own,bridgerton,bridgerton-series,bridgertons,bridgertons-series,chick-lit,currently-reading,default,e-book,e-books,ebook,ebooks,enemies-to-lovers,england,family,favorite,favorite-author,favorite-authors,favorite-series,favorites,favourites,favs,fiction,funny,guilty-pleasure,guilty-pleasures,historic,historic-romance,historical,historical-fiction,historical-regency,historical-romance,historical-romances,historicalromance,historicals,history,hr,humor,humorous,i-own,julia-quinn,keepers,kindle,library,library-book,love-hate,love-hate-relationship,m-f,made-me-laugh,marriage-of-convenience,my-books,nook,own-it,owned,owned-books,paperback,part-of-a-series,part-of-series,quinn,quinn-julia,re-read,read-2013,read-2014,read-2015,read-2016,read-in-2010,read-in-2011,read-in-2012,read-in-2013,read-in-2014,read-in-2015,read-in-2016,read-in-2017,regency,regency-romance,reread,reviewed,romance,romance-historical,romance-novels,romance-regency,romances,series,series-bridgertons,steamy,to-read,virgin-heroine","fiction,history, historical fiction, biography,romance",63898,Julia Quinn,3.98,567004,144491.0,Bridgertons,19.0,38086,1404,4.19

Tory Bodeen grew up in South Carolina, in a small run-down house, where her father ruled with an iron fist and a leather belt--and where her dreams and talents had no room to flourish. But she had Hope, who lived in the big house just a short skip away and whose friendship allowed Tory to be something she wasn't allowed to be at home: a child.
After young Hope's brutal murder, unsolved to this day, Tory's life began to fall apart. And now, as she returns to her hometown, with plans to settle in and open a stylish home-design shop, she is determined to find a measure of peace and free herself from the haunting visions of the past. As she forges a new bond with Cade Lavelle--Hope's older brother and the heir to the family fortune--she isn't sure whether the tragic loss they share will unite them or drive them apart. But she is willing to open her heart, just a little, and try.
Living so close to those unhappy memories will be more difficult and frightening than Tory could ever have expected, however.

Catherine Warner and Simon Nelson are best friends: total opposites, always together, and both unlucky in love. Cath is scatterbrained, messy, and-since she had her heart broken a few years back-emotionally closed off. Si is impossibly tidy, bitchy, and desperate for a man of his own. They live in London's West Hampstead along with their lifelong friends, Josh and Lucy, who are happily married with a devil-spawn child and a terrifying Swedish nanny, Ingrid.
All's well (sort of) until the sudden arrival of a college friend-the stunningly beautiful Portia, who's known for breaking hearts. Though they've grown up and grown apart from Portia, the four friends welcome her back into the fold. But does Portia have a hidden agenda or is she merely looking to reconnect with old friends? Her reappearance soon unleashes a rollicking series of events that tests the foursome's friendships to the limit and leaves them wondering if a happy ending is in store.
Fortunately, Cath has plenty to take her mind off Portia's schemes-like her gutsy decision to leave her job in advertising to fulfill her dream of opening a bookstore. And then there's James, the sexy real-estate agent who keeps dropping by even after the bookstore deal is done. With his irresistible smile and boyish charm could he be the one to melt Cath's heart?
Told with Jane Green's captivating wit and flare, Bookendsis above all a story about friendship-its twists, turns and complications-and how it weathers the challenges of love, ambition, marriage, and, most of all, growing up. Warmhearted, sophisticated, and full of delicious surprises, Bookendsis Green's most dazzling novel yet.","2002,2003,2004,2005,2006,5-stars,abandoned,adult,adult-fiction,audiobooks,beach-read,beach-reads,beachreads,book-club,books-about-books,books-i-have,books-i-own,borrowed,brain-candy,brit-chick-lit,brit-lit,british,british-chick-lit,chic-lit,chick,chick-lit,chick-lit-romance,chick-lits,chicklit,chiclit,comedy,contemporary,contemporary-fiction,contemporary-romance,currently-reading,default,ebook,ebooks,england,favorite-authors,favorites,favourites,fiction,fiction-read,fluff,friendship,fun-chick-lit,general,general-fiction,girly,girly-books,green,guilty-pleasures,have,have-read,humor,i-own,jane-green,kindle,lgbtq,library,library-book,lit,london,love,maybe,mine,my-books,my-library,novel,novels,on-my-shelf,own-it,own-to-read,owned,owned-books,paperback,read-in-2008,read-in-2009,read-in-2010,read-in-2011,read-in-2013,read-in-2016,realistic-fiction,relationships,reread,romance,shelfari-wishlist,standalone,summer-reads,to-buy,to-read,to-read-own,ultimate-reading-list,want,want-to-read,wish-list,women,women-s-fiction,womens-fiction","fiction,romance",12915,Jane Green,3.58,502125,,,,34139,842,3.7

Jaine Bright and her three girlfriends start off with the basics -- he'd be faithful and reliable, the responsible type, with a great sense of humor. But as the conversation picks up momentum, so do the quartet's requirements for Mr. Perfect -- and they write down a tongue-in-cheek checklist that's both funny and racy.

They were masters of the darkness, searching through eternity for a mistress of the light...
Would she find magic--or madness--in his dark embrace?
Young Savannah Dubrinsky was a mistress of illusion, a world-famous magician capable of mesmerizing millions. But there was one--Gregori, the Dark One--who held herin terrifying thrall. Whose cold silver eyes and heated sensuality sent shivers of danger, of desire, down her slender spine.
With a dark magic all his own, Gregori--the implacable hunter, the legendary healer, the most powerful of Carpathian males--whispered in Savannah's mind that he was her destiny. That she had been born to save his immortal soul. And now, here in New Orleans, the hour had finally come to claim her. To make her completely his. In a ritual as old as time...and as inescapable as eternity.","4-stars,5-stars,adult,adult-fiction,adult-paranormal,all-time-favorites,alpha-male,audio,audio-books,audiobook,audiobooks,author-christine-feehan,books,books-i-own,books-owned,borrowed,carpathian,carpathian-series,carpathians,carpathians-series,christine-feehan,christine-feehan-dark,christine-feehan-dark-series,contemporary,contemporary-romance,currently-reading,dark,dark-series,default,dnf,e-book,e-books,ebook,ebooks,erotica,fantasy,fantasy-paranormal,fantasy-romance,favorites,feehan,feehan--christine,feehan-christine,fiction,finished,have,i-own,kindle,library,library-book,m-f,m-f-romance,magic,mf,mine,my-books,my-library,nook,own-ebook,own-it,owned,owned-books,paperback,paranormal,paranormal-fantasy,paranormal-romance,paranormal-series,paranormal-urban-fantasy,paranormal-vampires,part-of-a-series,pnr,pnr-uf,re-read,read-in-2010,read-in-2011,read-in-2016,reread,romance,romance-novels,romance-paranormal,sci-fi-fantasy,series,shape-shifters,shapeshifter,shapeshifters,shifters,steamy,supernatural,supernatural-romance,suspense,to-buy,to-read,urban-fantasy,vamp,vampire,vampire-books,vampire-romance,vampires,vamps,virgin-heroine,wish-list","fantasy, paranormal,fiction,romance",6268,Christine Feehan,4.23,753718,163851.0,Dark,44.0,21795,600,4.24

After a near-fatal head injury, Navy SEAL lieutenant Tom Paoletti catches a glimpse of an international terrorist in his New England hometown. When he calls for help, the Navy dismisses the sighting as injury-induced imaginings. In a last-ditch effort to prevent disaster, Tom creates his own makeshift counterterrorism team, assembling his most loyal officers, two elderly war veterans, a couple of misfit teenagers, and Dr. Kelly Ashton. As the town's infamous bad boy, Tom was always in love with Kelly, a sweet ""girl next door"" who has grown into a remarkable woman. Now he has one final chance for happiness, one last chance to win her heart, and one desperate chance to save the day.

In True Devotion, which kicks off bestselling author Dee Henderson's Uncommon Heroes series, lifeguard Kelly Jacobs mechanically goes through the motions of living while seeking to alleviate her grief over the death of her beloved spouse. When Kelly saves the life of young teen Ryan Raines in a daring rescue at sea, his father Charles showers her with attention--and draws Kelly into a sinister plot that may endanger her best friend and new romantic interest, Navy SEAL lieutenant Joe ""Bear"" Baker. Henderson's strong women characters have an appealing combination of toughness and vulnerability, and she's not afraid of exploring their spiritual side as well as spotlighting their heroics. The sprinkling of military terminology throughout the book might initially seem daunting, but a glossary at the beginning of the novel will help readers who are unfamiliar with the lingo. Henderson excels in concocting just the right blend of romance and edge-of-your-seat action to keep the pages turning. --Cindy Crosby","action,adult,adult-fiction,adult-lit,audible,audio,audiobook,audiobooks,books-i-own,books-we-own,chick-lit,christian,christian-books,christian-fiction,christian-lit,christian-literature,christian-mystery,christian-romance,christian-romantic-suspense,christian-suspense,christianfiction,clean,contemporary,contemporary-fiction,contemporary-romance,currently-reading,dee,dee-henderson,dee-henderson-books,default,didn-t-finish,drama,e-book,e-books,ebook,ebooks,faith,favorite,favorites,fiction,finished,free,freebie,general-fiction,henderson,henderson-dee,heroes,i-own,inspirational,inspirational-fiction,inspirational-romance,kindle,kindle-books,kindle-freebie,kindle-to-read,library,men-in-uniform,military,military-fiction,military-romance,my-books,my-library,mysteries,mystery,mystery-suspense,mystery-thriller,nook,on-kindle-to-read,own-read,owned,owned-books,part-of-a-series,part-of-series,re-read,read-2016,read-again,read-christian,read-in-2012,read-in-2013,read-in-2015,read-in-2016,realistic-fiction,religious,religious-fiction,romance,romantic,romantic-suspense,seals,series,shelfari-favorites,suspence,suspense,tbr-owned,thriller,to-buy,to-read,uncommon,uncommon-heroes,uncommon-heroes-series,wish-list","fiction,mystery, thriller, crime,romance",165519,Dee Henderson,4.29,164987,185857.0,Uncommon Heroes,5.0,9513,252,4.29

They have defied the cliches, keeping their marriage together for decades. Their children -- Samantha, Scott, and Allegra -- are successful and happy, but must face challenges we fear for our own children as well.
As an attorney for the stars, twenty-nine-year-old Allegra Steinberg is used to negotiating major movie deals, and fielding phone calls at all hours of the day and night. But she has little time for private life -- until a chance encounter with a New York writer turns her life upside down. Suddenly , Allegra finds herself planning a wedding at her parents' Bel Air home.
As preparations begin for a September ceremony, surprise announcements and ever-increasing anxiety bring out the best and worst in everyone. But as couples in each generation of the Steinberg family struggle with broken vows and new hopes, the real meaning of Allegra's wedding emerges. For the bride, the ceremony is a bridge between her past and her future. For her parents, it is a reminder of the bond that holds them all together. And for both families, it is an opportunity for reconciliation, and new hope.
In a compelling portrait of real people on an unreal world, Danielle Steel uses Hollywood as a backdrop to reveal the dreams, the fears, and the expectations of a ceremony that unites us all and changes lives forever....","1,2-star,2000,2001,24,adult,adult-fiction,audio,audio-books,audiobook,audiobooks,audios-dark-green,beach-reads,biblioteca,book,books,books-i-got-rid-of,books-i-have,books-i-own,books-i-own-18,books-read-in-2013,bookshelf-2017,calibre,california,cheesy-romance,chic-lit,chick-lit,contemporary,contemporary-romance,currently-reading,d-steel,danielle,danielle-steel,danielle-steel-books,danielle-steele,danielstellecolection,default,did-not-finish,done-reading,drama,e-book,english,epubs,favorite,favorite-reads,favorites,favourites,fiction,fiction-shelves,finished,finished-reading,gave-away,gift-from-goodreads-friend,guilty-pleasure,hardcover,have,home-bookshelf,i-own,in-library,kindle,library-books,love,love-story,loveley-book-to-read-when-on-holida,mom,mom-i-read-garage-sale,my-book,my-books,my-collection,my-library,non-favourites,novel,novels,on-my-shelf,own-fiction,own-it,own-to-read,owned,owned-books,read-2013,read-in-2015,reading-list,relationships,romance,romance-drama,romances,shelf-h,shelfari-favorites,sold,stand-alone,steel,steel-danielle,steele,steele-danielle,the-wedding,to-read,want-to-read,womens-fiction,دانيال-ستيل,روايات","fiction,romance",14255,Danielle Steel,3.82,621934,,,,5856,151,3.73

Thirty-something Dr. Natalie Carmichael has it all--a busy family practice in a small town, a great old Victorian house she inherited from a beloved aunt, and a handsome husband of six years with a thriving sales career in prosthetic limbs. But her perfect world begins to unravel when a man shows up demanding the jewelry she's wearing in return for a debt her husband Raymond owes. Natalie is still reeling when she receives a phone call that Raymond has been in a minor car accident. She rushes to the hospital with thoughts of strangling the truth out of him, only to discover that two other women have beaten her there, both claiming to be married to Raymond!
Fifty-something socialite Beatrix Carmichael knows Raymond married her for her money, but she loves the cad anyway. Over the years, though, their childless marriage and his constant traveling have driven her to drink, pop pills, and keep the home shopping channels in business. When she gets a call that Raymond's been in an accident, she actually relishes the thought of him lying captive in bed, forced to spend time with her. But when Beatrix arrives to find two other women vying for a place by his bedside, she's looking for a plug to pull.
Twenty-one-year-old Ruby Lynn Carmichael thought she'd hit the jackpot when she met Raymond at the strip club where she works. He swept her off her feet, gave her a big fat ring, and bought her a double-wide trailer as a wedding gift. Ruby thought her life was set...until she learns that Raymond has two other wives in the wings, and the women aren't exhibiting a very sharing spirit. Still, Ruby Lynn has a secret growing inside her that will ensure she gets what's coming to her.
When over-committed Raymond Carmichael dies suddenly, his wives are grief-stricken and furious not to have the chance to confront him about his triple betrayal. But their heartache turns to suspicion when it's revealed that Raymond was murdered. They all have means and motive, yet they each profess their innocence. To save themselves, this unlikely trio band together to track down a killer, and along the way, find a lot more than they bargained for.","2002,2012-books,a-to-z-challenge-2013,adult,amazon,amazon-freebies,audio,audio-book,audiobook,bitch-or-bastard,book-club,books-i-own,books-read-in-2012,chic-lit,chick-lit,chicklit,comedy,contemporary,contemporary-fiction,contemporary-romance,cozy-mystery,currently-reading,default,did-not-finish,disappointing,dnf,e-book,e-books,ebook,ebooks,favorites,fiction,finished,fluff,for-fun,free,free-kindle-books,freebie,freebies,fucked-up-family,funny,have,humor,humorous-mystery,humour,i-own-tbr,kindle,kindle-book,kindle-books,kindle-ebook,kindle-freebie,kindle-lendable,kindle-own,kindle-owned,kindle-read,kindle-reads,kindle-to-read,kindle-unlimited,kindle-unread,law-or-rule-braker,light-mystery,love-triangle,made-a-baby,murder-mystery,my-books,my-ebooks,my-kindle-books,my-kindle-editions,mysteries,mystery,mystery-and-suspense-series,mystery-crime,mystery-suspense,mystery-thriller,needs-better-epilogue,nook,novel,on-kindle,on-my-kindle,on-the-kindle,own-it,owned,owned-kindle,read-2012,read-2014,read-2015,read-in-2012,read-on-kindle,romance,romantic,romantic-comedy,romantic-suspense,stephanie-bond,summer-reading,suspense,thriller,to-read,women,women-s-fiction,womens-fiction","fiction,mystery, thriller, crime,romance",167400,Stephanie Bond,3.85,92893,,,,4837,392,3.54

I'd been prowling the crumbling ruins of Castle Weyrcraig for so long that I could no longer remember if I was man or beast. Then one stormy night the superstitious Highlanders of Ballybliss decided to leave a helpless virgin bound to a stake in the castle courtyard to satisfy my insatiable appetites.
My demands might strike terror in the hearts of men, but this bold beauty dared to defy me. After she informed me that she didn't believe in dragons, I had no choice but to make her my prisoner--or risk being exposed to those I had sought to deceive with my dangerous masquerade.
Soon I found myself stealing into the moonlit tower just to watch her sleep. Little does she know that beneath this beast's gruff exterior beats the passionate heart of a man. Gwendolyn Wilder may not believe in dragons, but I intend to use all my sensual wiles to teach her to believe in something even more magical--true love.

And as the next generation of the Hartes and Madisons, Hannah and Rafe are expected to hate each other too. But Hannah Harte, a successful wedding consultant with a skeptical view of marriage, remembers the long-ago night on the beach that revealed Rafe as much more than just ""that disreputable Madison boy."" And Rafe remembers the heroic gesture that proved Hannah's fierce spirit was stronger than any feud and saved him from near-certain imprisonment.
Now reunited by a surprising inheritance after years of living their separate lives, Rafe and Hannah return to Eclipse Bay, and the hostilities that still divide, and bind, their families. And they are discovering something that is at once delightful and deeply disturbing ...
They don't hate each other.

But she will also discover deep emotion strengths in herself, along with the courage to celebrate the joy each day can bring -- with or without the man she loves.","1st-vol-reading,300-400pg,5-star-reads,a-a-fiction,a-a-writers,a-brothers-honor,aa-fiction,adult,adult-fiction,aframerrom,african-american,african-american-authors,african-american-fiction,african-american-literature-fiction,african-american-romance,africanamericanerotica-streetlit,all-time-favorites,alpha-alpha-hot-alpha,archived,audiobooks,authors-poc,bad-boys,bawl-my-eyes-out,black-authors,black-books,black-diamond,black-fiction,black-love,book-club,bookies,books-added-in-2014,books-at-home,books-i-have,books-i-own,books-i-ve-read,books-read-in-2016,carl-weber,contemporary-romance,currently-reading,default,diversity-challenge,don-t-own,drama-romance,erotic-romance,erotica,erotica-books,faves,favorite-books-authors,favorites,fiction,fiction-books-read,finish-later,fun-stuff,great-read,guilty-pleasures,hard-copy,have-read,i-own-hardcopy-paperback,interested,kindle-books,lots-of-dramaaaaa,love-triangle,lovers-separation,mar-b-morrison-honey-b,mary-b-morrison,mary-morrison,mature-erotica,millionaire-billionaire-boyfriend,mssheila-s,multicultrual,my-books,my-library,not-interested,own-but-unread,owned,owned-books,passion,personal-library,play-store,read-and-own,read-on-paperback,read-urban-fiction,reading,readsoullit,refused-to-read,rereads,romance,sample,scandal,series,shakia,shelfari-favorites,soulmates-dissipate-series,sylvia-s-audio-books,to-read,urban,urban-fiction,urban-reads,yeas,youthful-relics","fiction,romance",7856,Mary B.

58261,['59850'],Sunset in St.Tropez,2000,['eng'],288.0,"In her 55th bestselling novel, Danielle Steel explores the seasons of an extraordinary friendship, weaving the story of three couples, lifelong friends, for whom a month's holiday in St. Tropez becomes a summer of change, revelation, secrets, surprises, and new beginnings...
As Diana Morrison laid the table for six at her elegant Central Park apartment, there was no warning of what was to come. Spending New Year's Eve together was a sacred tradition for Diana, her husband of thirty-two years, Eric, and their best friends, Pascale and John Donnally and Anne and Robert Smith. The future looked rosy as the long-time friends sipped champagne and talked of renting a villa together in the South of France the following summer. But life had other plans...
Just two weeks after New Year's, tragedy strikes the heart of their close circle, as Robert Smith suffers a sudden, unexpected loss. Without hesitation, Diana and Eric, Pascale and John rally to his side, united in their support, love, and shared grief. Convinced that a change of scenery is just what Robert needs, they urge him to join them on the Riviera in August. But as they soon discover, the ramshackle old mansion they rented in St. Tropez--sight unseen--is far different from the exquisite villa and sun-drenched gardens touted in the brochure. Cobwebs hang from the ceiling. Beds collapse beneath them. All while a would-be housekeeper in a leopard-skin bikini and six-inch heels sashays through the house with a trio of yapping poodles at her heels. But the biggest surprise of all is the woman Robert invites to the villa as his guest--a lovely, much-younger film actress with mile-long legs and a million-dollar smile. Diana and Pascale hate her on sight. But the men are dazzled. And amid the crumbling furniture and the glorious sunsets, the strained relationships and the acts of forgiveness, more surprises are in store for the villa's occupants. With the last days of summer fast approaching, each couple finds themselves changing in unexpected ways, as old wounds are healed, new love discovered, and miracles unfold...all beneath the dazzling sun of St. Tropez.
By turns wise and moving, heartbreaking and wickedly funny, Danielle Steel's new novel is about forgiving without forgetting, about the sorrow that shadows our lives and the hope that saves us. And it is about once-in-a-lifetime friendships...the kind that heal, sustain, and change us forever.","2000-s,2002,25,5-star,abandoned,adult,adult-fiction,amazon-books,american,american-literature,audio,audio-book,audio-books,audiobook,back-in-the-day,beach-related,before-goodreads,books,books-i-got-rid-of,books-i-have,books-i-own,books-read-hard-cover-b4-kindle,brigitte-prior,brought-by-brig-and-graham,bøker-jeg-eier,c-21,calibre,chic-lit,chick-lit,contemporary,continuous-color-collection,currently-reading,d-steel,daniell-steel,danielle-steel,danielle-steele,danielle-steele-hardback,default,e-book,e-books,e-library-ebook,ebook,ebooks,english-books-in-stock,epl-to-read-audio,favorites,fiction,finished,finished-reading,general-adult-fiction,general-fiction,girls,hardcover,have,have-read,i-own,kathy,kindle,library,library-wishlist,libri-che-ho,literature,ma-2017,mom,my-books,my-bookshelve,my-danielle-steel,my-library,my-little-library,my-teenager-book-list,novel,novels,on-my-shelf,on-the-shelf,overdrive-app,own-but-not-read,own-not-read-yet,own-the-book,own-to-read,owned,owned-books,paperback,pgs-200-299,procitano,read-in-2008,read-in-2012,read-in-2017,read-in-italian,romance,romance-contemporary,romance-drama,romance-novels,stand-alone,steel,steel-danielle,steele-danielle,summer,to-read,weng,wish-list","fiction,romance",14255,Danielle Steel,3.82,621934,,,,3629,108,3.63

To her legions of adoring suitors, it comes as quite a shock when Lady Sophie York rejects an offer of marriage from the dashing, rakish Patrick Foakes in favor of amiable but dull Braddon Chatwin. He may be an earl, but it is Patrick's stolen kisses that sear her lips.
When Patrick, in disguise, scales a ladder to retrieve his friend's fiancee, he never expects the elopement to be his own. Neither does Sophie, Braddon, or the rest of the tattling ton. One hasty wedding later, the passionate innocent and the sophisticated rogue play out their own intricate dance as Sophie masters what it takes to keep a man where he belongs.

To her family, Natalie Seebring is a woman who prizes appearances. She is exquisitely mannered, socially adept, a supportive wife, and head of a successful wine-producing enterprise. So when she announces plans to marry a vineyard employee mere months after the death of her husband of fifty-eight years, her son and daughter are stunned. Faced with their disapproval, Natalie decides to write a memoir. There is much that her children don't know about her life -- about her love of the vineyard, her role in fighting to build it up, and the sacrifices she made for her family.
Olivia Jones is a dreamer, living vicariously through the old photographs she restores. She and her daughter, Tess, have no one but themselves, so they cling to the fantasy that a big, happy family is out there somewhere, just waiting to welcome them home. When Olivia is hired by Natalie to help with her memoir, a summer at Natalie's beautiful vineyard by the sea seems the perfect opportunity to live out that fantasy -- an elegant home by the shore, a salary that allows her to hire a tutor for her dyslexic daughter, a job that is creative, hours spent with a woman who has led a charmed life.
But all is not as it seems, Olivia and Tess discover when they arrive at Asquonset, the vineyard in Rhode Island. While welcoming, Natalie is not quite the mothering type, as is quickly evident in the hostility her daughter and son have toward her -- it's a hostility that Olivia must buffer. Another dose of stark reality comes in the form of Simon Burke, who runs the vineyard's day-to-day operation and sees in Olivia and Tess an unwelcome reminder of the wife and daughter he tragically lost. And then there is the cruel reality of Olivia's own life -- the mother who never wanted her, and a career that has floundered.
Natalie's story, intended for her own children, enlightens Olivia as well. The lives of these two women of different generations, parallel in so many ways, become, in The Vineyard, a powerful and moving story as the fantasy of an idealized life, complete with perfect romance, crashes headlong into reality.","2000,2002,2017-books-read,60-books-in-2017,a-tbr-pile,a-to-z-reading-challenge,adult,adult-fiction,all,audio-book,barbara-delinsky,barbara-delinsky-books,book-club,books,books-i-have,books-i-own,books-read-in-2009,chic-lit,chick-lit,chick-lit-genre,chicklit,comfort-reads,contemporary,contemporary-romance,copies-1,cover-me-white,cozy-reads,currently-reading,default,delinsky,delinsky--barbara,delinsky-barbara,donated,drama,e-book,family-relationships,favorites,fiction,finished,friend-recommended,general-fiction,guilty-pleasures,have,i-have-it,i-own,in-my-library,june-adult-fiction,kindle,kindle-ipad,library,local_author,love-story,my-library,mystery,nah,nook-books,not-ebook-avail,not-to-read,novels,on-hold,on-pc,on-shelf,outbound,own-book,owned,owned-books,owned-f,owned-verified,paperback,pop-fiction,q-winemaker-winebusiness,read-2009,read-2017,read-in-2005,read-in-2010,read-in-2012,read-in-2017,read-pre-2009,read-romance,realistic-fiction,remove,rhode-island,romance,romance-to-read,romantic,sabrina,store,to-read,to-read-get,to-read-someday,un-categorized,unread-books-i-own,wine-making,wish-list,women-s-fiction,womens-fiction,womens-lit,zz-chick-lit,zz-contemporary,zz-romance","fiction,mystery, thriller, crime,romance",36492,Barbara Delinsky,3.73,150663,,,,3187,163,3.830000000000001

For everyone but herself...
After her marriage to Damien ended in disaster, Londoner Josie Flynn - thirtysomething and single again - is flying across the ocean to her American cousin's 'big mistake' wedding. In her present 'love stinks' frame of mind, the last person she expects to be seated next to on the flight is someone like Matt Jarvis. A recently divorced rock journalist, Matt is sensitive, good-looking and remarkably attentive - and before their plane touches down, Josie's smitten. So how can she hope to convince her cousin to cut and run when Josie is all ready to leap into love again - with a stranger, no less, who might be just another Mr Totally Wrong in Mr Seductively Right's clothing?
The point is rendered moot, of course, once they land in New York and she and Matt go their separate ways. After all Josie's got prenuptial confabs to worry about and that dreaded lilac chiffon bridesmaid's dress to wear. But Dante himself couldn't have dreamed up the hell this wedding is proving to be - and when her dream hunk reappears and throws himself into the mix, Josie finds herself wondering how she - or any unattached modern woman - can hope to survive the new romantic rules of the twenty-first century.

1252754,['251975'],Temptation,2000,['eng'],,"Deveraux's Latest Temptation
Hidden secrets, high passion, and a healthy dose of humor are Deveraux hallmarks, and Temptationis one of her best. The tempting bestseller features a fish-out-of-water heroine, a hidden family treasure, and a Scottish laird who would rather die than be married.
Temperance O'Neil is a women's rights activist in New York City at the turn of the 20th century. At the age of 29, she had given little thought, time, or attention to her love life and thrown all of her energy into helping the city's poor and downtrodden women. But when Temperance's widowed mother shows up with her new husband, Angus McCairn, everything changes. Angus has control over the O'Neil money and uses it to force Temperance to move to Scotland, where he's determined to make a ""proper"" lady of her. This results in a brief but amusing battle of wills that culminates in a blackmail deal: If Temperance can make Angus's nephew, James, take a wife within the next six months, then she can have her money and her house back.
Temperance travels to James's home in the Highlands, only to discover a huge, filthy, ramshackle house and a style of living that is far from the city ways she is used to. Showing up under the guise of being the new housekeeper, Temperance sets about tidying up the place and finding James the perfect woman. While trying to sneak a humorous parade of inappropriate candidates past James's watchful eye, Temperance finds herself falling in love with the man. But just as she comes to this realization, the perfect match for James shows up: his childhood sweetheart, who is now a widow. Torn between the work she once did, her passion for the people in her new life, and her love for James, Temperance makes a hard decision that forces her to risk everything she holds dear.
Deveraux makes good use of historical detail and creates characters who are charmingly and believably flawed. There's a fun mystery to solve regarding a hidden family treasure and the reason behind Angus's determination to see his nephew married off, and plenty of obstacles to overcome. All of it is seasoned with Deveraux's trademark humor and passion, a recipe that never fails to satisfy.

Choose a bride from this year's debutantes. Decide on a proper settlement. Send an announcement to The Times. Inform the bride of her good fortune.
Rules of Respectability
Devon Mathewes, earl of Kerrich, has a plan that is sure to restore him to the Queen's favor.First, he must hire a sensible, unattractive governess. Next, he will see to adopting a properly grateful orphan, which will surely lend him a patina of respectability. Finally, he must obtain a guarantee that his orphan and the governess will better his character and reputation without unduly disturbing his life--love life or otherwise.
Rules of Passion
As a condition of accepting the governess position, Miss Pamela Lockhart of the Distinguished Academy of Governesses has a few rules of her own. Devon at all times must behave with propriety, an unlikely accomplishment that would delight the ton and completely astonish Pamela herself. She must be allowed to choose a suitable orphan at her own discretion. Most important, Devon must vow to neverever delve into Pamela's background, or her appearance, lest he discover the truth behind the deepest secrets of her heart.

What can a respectable Regency miss do when kidnapped by a nobleman intent on marriage? Why, marry him, of course.Julia Frant has secretly loved Alec MacLean, the wild Viscount Hunterston from afar. So when he accidentally snatches her instead of her lovely, scheming cousin for an elopement to Gretna Green, Julia leaps at the chance to make her passionate dreams come true.
Alec's in no position to quibble: if he doesn't marry by midnight and live scandal-free for a year, he loses his inheritance. At least marriage with do-gooder Julia will guarantee his fortune. But as his plain brown wren transforms herself into an elegant swan, Alec suddenly can't stay away from his last-minute wife---and when he kisses her, the inheritance is the last thing on his mind. Unfortunately, scandal can occur from the best of intentions...and Julia is never short of good intentions!","1,1st-in-series,2013-reads,2016-read,3-star,33-keepers,a-romance-historical,abandoned,abduction,abduction-seduction-series,adult,books-i-own,comedy,completed-series-to-read,couldn-t-finish,currently-reading,default,did-not-finish,dnf,donate,e-book,e-books,ebook,ebooks,england,epub,favorite,favorites,favourites,fiction,first-in-series,five-star-books,genre-historical,good-read,have,hawkins,hawkins-karen,hero-viscount,highlander,historic,historical,historical-fiction,historical-regency,historical-romance,historical-romance-england,historical-romance-tbr,historical-romances,historical-to-read,historicals,home-library,hr,ibooks,karen-hawkins,kidnapped,kidnapping,kindle,library,marriage-of-convenience,maybe,mistaken-identity,my-books,no,nook,not-interested,on-kindle,opposites-attract,owned,owned-books,paperback,paperbacks,part-of-a-series,part-of-series,plain-jane,re-read,read-2012,read-in-2012,read-in-2013,regency,regency-romance,rogues-series,romance,romance-historical,romance-novels,romance-regency,romance-to-read,scottish-romance,scribd,secret-love,series,setting-england,shelfari-wishlist,spinster,tbr,to-buy,to-read,ugly-duckling,unrequited-love,virgin-heroine,wallflower,wish-list","fiction,history, historical fiction, biography,romance",4633,Karen Hawkins,3.93,56290,151453.0,Rogues,3.0,2616,135,3.8

Providing round-the-clock protection for him is out of the question . . . right?
Nick needs Daisy around to keep the hired thugs who are out for his blood from actually getting it. If he can make amends for the way he screwed up nine years ago in the process, then so much the better. Except time has done nothing to dull the memory of how Daisy once rocked his world off its axis, and her cocky attitude and mouthwatering curves still have the power to turn his brain to mush.

Bastard daughter to the king, Rosamunde was raised in a convent and wholly prepared to take the veil . . . until King Henry declared she would wed Aric, one of his most valiant knights. Suddenly she found herself promising to love, honor, and obey.
Rosamunde's education had not covered a wedding night, but the handsome warrior she was now bound to seemed intent on giving her a lesson in the art of pleasure. In no time, Aric was certain she would surrender to the irresistible passion he promised.
And while Rosamunde's spirited nature often put her at odds with her new husband, his mastery in seduction was quickly melting her resolve--and capturing her heart.","2016-books,2016-read,4-stars,abandoned,adult,arc,arranged-forced-marriage,arranged-marriage,audible,audio,audio-book,audiobook,audiobooks,books,books-i-have,books-i-own,calibre,calibre-library,chick-lit,currently-reading,default,did-not-finish,dnf,e-book,e-books,ebook,ebook-collection,ebooks,edelweiss,england,era-medieval-450-1485,faves,favorite,favorite-authors,favorites,fiction,funny,genre-historical,good-read,guilty-pleasures,have,hero-beta-sweet,heroine-virgin,highlander-romance,highlanders,historic-romance,historical,historical-england,historical-fiction,historical-romance,historicals,humor,humorous,humour,i-own,kindle,l-sands,laugh-out-loud,library,lol,love,lyndsay-sands,lynsay-sands,m-f,marriage,marriage-of-convenience,medieval,medieval-romance,military-men,mine,moc,my-books,my-ebooks,own-kindle,own-to-read,owned,owned-books,owned-not-read,paperback,plot-forced-arranged-marriage,probably-not-getting-back-to-it,read-2016,read-in-2015,read-in-2017,ready-to-read,reviewed,romance,romance-historical,romance-read,sands,sands-lynsay,scottish-romance,series,setting-england,shelfari-wishlist,stand-alone,standalone,to-buy,to-read,virgin-heroine","fiction,history, historical fiction, biography,romance",17059,Lynsay Sands,4.12,445073,,,,2049,134,3.85

Sometimes I feel like I'm saving myself for her
Not that way. Not sexually. Saving my life. Trying to be smart about what I do. Actually giving a damn. Because I matter to her. It's something I've never had -- anyone who cares like she does -- and it's absolutely amazing.
She's amazing, this very good girl I can not have. Her dad made that clear the night he caught us together, but that's not enough to stop me from me from wanting her.
Still, it would be a completely selfish move on my part to draw her any deeper into my life. I just heard my mom's getting out of prison early. Not for good behavior. Because of overcrowding. Life was always crazy with mom. If she comes back, if she wants me back, my life turns to crap. I know that, and at sixteen, I don't think I can do anything about it, except maybe run as far and fast as I can. Even Dana, my very good girl, won't be able to save me.

You met Heatherington in The Sherbrooke Bride and Helen Mayberry in Mad Jack. Now the two get together to track down a mystical treasure that Helen calls King Edward's Lamp.
Helen is a big girl - only two inches shorter than Heatherington - a resolute taskmistress, owner of her own inn. She adores her father, Lord Prith, and wants to find the lamp more than anything. It is her only passion - until she meets Heatherington.
Spenser Heatherington, Lord Beecham, enjoys Helen's pursuit of him. He is a renowned womanizer, a resolute bachelor, and really enjoys his life. When she throws him to the ground and sits on him, and he finally admits that he will succumb to her, she informs him, to his chagrin, that she doesn't want a lover, she wants a partner.
But things work out a bit differently than either of them expect. Indeed, Heatherington, unused to being thwarted, takes drastic steps to change his ""big girl's"" mind.
Do they find Helen's lamp? Is there more to this treasure than either of them knows? Listen and find out . . .
I hope you enjoy visiting the Sherbrookes when they stick their oars into the treasure hunt.

Five years ago, Shannon Astor left the beautiful high-mountain country of West Texas as a single mother. She was desperate for a fresh start...and a way to keep the secrets of her past buried. It almost worked.
Until a chance to make a better life for her daughter leads her right back home. To the very place of the past betrayals.
But it also leads Shannon to horse-trainer Jack MacGowan--her handsome high-school nemesis, now a widowed father. His daughter looks so startlingly like her own that Shannon can't help but question the circumstances surrounding her daughter's birth.

Book One
When Cecilia Randall, and her naval officer husband, Ian, appear in Judge Olivia Lockhart's Cedar Cove family court, they expect the good judge to grant the divorce they seek. But Olivia senses the couple still love one another and just need time to work on their marriage in the wake of their infant daughter's death. So Olivia denies their petition and makes headlines in the Cedar Cove Chronicle, earning the divorced mother more than journalistic admiration from the paper's editor, Jack Griffin. Meanwhile, Olivia's daughter, Justine, must decide if she will marry an older man her mother insists is wrong for her, and Olivia's best friend, Grace Sherman, the local librarian, is frantic with the disappearance of her husband, Dan. Everyone in Cedar Cove is talking!
204 Rosewood Lane
Book Two
Six months after her husband of 35 years, Dan, disappeared, Grace Sherman is confident he's run off with another woman, so, against her daughter, Kelly's wishes, she files for divorce. Meanwhile, Judge Olivia has love problems of her own. Her ex-husband wants her back, giving her on-again, off-again suitor, Jack Griffin, some stiff competition. Jack has other problems. His son, Eric, comes home to bunk with dad, on the outs with his girlfriend, Shelly, who thinks she's pregnant. Olivia's daughter, Justine, wises up and marries her high school sweetheart, but Zach and Rosie Cox find their marriage on the skids when Rosie's volunteer work takes precedence over her family responsibilities. Maryellen Sherman, Grace's older daughter and manager of the local art gallery, becomes pregnant after a brief affair with artist Jon Bowman. Romance, babies, divorce and marriage keep Cedar Cove gossips buzzing.
311 Pelican Court
Book Three
Now divorced, Zach and Rosie Cox are struggling to adjust to Judge Olivia's unusual custody agreement--and to the fact they're thrown together more than they would have wished. The kids are staying in the family home, and it's Rosie and Zach who have to do the coming and going. Having discovered the tragic fate of her husband, Grace tries to adjust to single living and to the attentions of another man.
But the really big gossip comes when a guest dies at Bob and Peggy Beldon's Thyme and Tide Bed and Breakfast. Roy McAfee, the local private investigator, wants to know who the guy was, and why he showed up there, of all places, in the middle of the night.
44 Cranberry Point
Book Four
Judge Olivia and her husband, Jack, are back from their honeymoon to find her mother, Charlotte, who's at least seventy-five, has a man in her life. But the big buzz is about the man who died in the Beldon's bed and breakfast. Turns out, his name was Max Russell, and Bob knew him briefly in Vietnam. But who poisoned him and why?
In happier news, Jon Bowman and Maryellen Sherman have seen the light--they're getting married. Maryellen's mom, Grace, has more than her share of interested men, but which one will she choose? All grist for the gossip mill in Cedar Cove, the town you'd love to call home.

Book Five
Roy McAfee, Cedar Cove's resident private investigator, and his wife, Corrie, have been receiving anonymous postcards and messages, asking if they regret the past, and what they mean is a mystery to them! On a more positive note, Roy and Corrie are delighted that their daughter, Linette, has moved back to Cedar Cove to work at the new medical clinic. Linette isn't too enthusiastic that her mom has set her up with Cal Washburn, who works at Cliff Harding's horse farm. Corrie bought Linette a date with Cal at the humane society's ""Dog and Bachelor Auction."" The romance between Cliff and Grace Sherman is back, but that's just one of the many interesting stories you'll read about in 50 Harbor Street.

Seth assumes they will rebuild, but Justine likes not having to worry about the restaurant. It's as if they don't know each other anymore. But could something unexpected rekindle their love, say in nine months? Still, there's good news in Cedar Cove. Cal, who works on Cliff Harding's ranch, is rescuing wild mustangs from Wyoming but might find he's better suited for other adventures. And a Victorian Tea Room and Gift Shop could be in the works.
