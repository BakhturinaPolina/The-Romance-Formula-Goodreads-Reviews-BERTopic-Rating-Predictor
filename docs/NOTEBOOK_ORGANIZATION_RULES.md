# Notebook Organization Rules

## Always Add Titles and Subtitles

### Rule: Make Notebooks Reader-Friendly with Clear Structure

When working with Jupyter notebooks, **ALWAYS** add markdown cells with descriptive titles and subtitles to make the code more reader-friendly and accessible.

### Implementation Guidelines:

#### 1. **Section Headers**
- Use markdown cells with `##` for main sections
- Use `###` for subsections
- Include relevant emojis for visual appeal and quick identification

#### 2. **Content Structure**
Each section should include:
- **Clear title** explaining what the section does
- **Brief description** of the purpose and importance
- **List of key operations** or methods being used
- **Context** for why this analysis is needed

#### 3. **Example Structure**
```markdown
## 📊 Data Loading and Initial Setup

This section handles the loading of the dataset and performs initial data exploration to understand the structure and content of our data.

### What this section does:
- Loads the dataset from specified file paths
- Checks file availability and creates output directories
- Performs initial data shape and structure analysis
```

#### 4. **Benefits**
- **Clear Navigation**: Readers can quickly find relevant sections
- **Educational Value**: Explains statistical methods and their purpose
- **Context Setting**: Helps readers understand the analysis workflow
- **Professional Presentation**: Makes notebooks look polished and academic
- **Collaboration**: Easier for team members to understand and contribute

#### 5. **When to Apply**
- **Always** when creating new notebooks
- **Always** when adding new analysis sections
- **Always** when the notebook will be shared or published
- **Always** when the analysis involves multiple steps or complex methods

#### 6. **Section Types to Always Title**
- Data loading and setup
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis
- Statistical testing
- Visualization creation
- Results interpretation
- Conclusions and recommendations

### Remember: A well-organized notebook is a professional notebook!
